00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:06.537
I'm Peppa Pig. This
is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:08.438
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:10.935
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:14.536
Peppa Pig.

4
00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:22.548
Gardening!

5
00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:27.256
Peppa and George are playing at
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig's house.

6
00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.458
Grandpa! Catch!

7
00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.056
Catch!

8
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.067
What's this?

9
00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:41.831
Dine-Saw! Grrrrr!

10
00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.836
A dinosaur!

11
00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:48.835
Grandpa, What are you doing?

12
00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:51.577
I'm planting these seeds.

13
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.841
Seeds? What do seeds do?

14
00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.585
Seeds grow into plants.

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.855
I just make a little hole
and put the seed in.

16
00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:06.359
Then I cover it With earth
and Water it.

17
00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:08.989
Everything in my garden

18
00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:12.097
grows from tiny seeds
like these.

19
00:01:12.804 --> 00:01:14.567
Even the big apple tree?

20
00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:15.932
Oh! Yes!

21
00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.571
This tiny seed...

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.878
...Will grow into
a little apple tree, like this.

23
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:24.109
Oooh.

24
00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:26.440
And that little apple tree

25
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:30.448
Will grow into a big apple tree like this.

26
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:33.619
Ouch!

27
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.393
Mmmm !

28
00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:43.899
And inside this apple are more seeds.

29
00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:46.632
To make more apple trees!

30
00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:48.603
Exactly!

31
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.902
Grandpa! Grandpa!
I Want to plant a seed!

32
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:55.845
Would you like to plant
a strawberry seed?

33
00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:57.045
Yes, please!

34
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.149
This seed Will grow into
a Iovely strawberry plant.

35
00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.122
First, make a little hole.

36
00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:10.555
Then I put the seed in
and cover it With earth.

37
00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:13.423
Shall I Water it for you?

38
00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.927
No! No! I Want to Water it.

39
00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:22.164
Good! Now We
Wait for it to grow.

40
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.944
Peppa and George are Waiting
for the seed to grow.

41
00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:31.005
It's not doing anything!

42
00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.180
You Will have
to be patient, Peppa.

43
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.084
It Will take a long time
to grow.

44
00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:41.023
Peppa! George!
It's time to go home.

45
00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.191
But We're Waiting for
my strawberry plant to grow!

46
00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:48.029
I Wanted strawberries for teas.

47
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:49.956
Don't Worry, Peppa.

48
00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:51.763
Next time you come,

49
00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:54.194
the seed Will have
grown into a plant.

50
00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:57.464
And We Will have
strawberries!

51
00:02:57.976 --> 00:02:58.908
Yes.

52
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.700
Come on, Peppa.

53
00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.710
Bye bye, Grandpa.
Bye bye, strawberry.

54
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.721
Grandpa Pig looks after
Peppa's strawberry plant.

55
00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:17.056
After many days,

56
00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.055
Grandpa Pig finds a tiny plant growing.

57
00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:23.066
Day by day, the plant
grows bigger and bigger.

58
00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:27.928
Then one day, Grandpa Pig
finds something very special.

59
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.066
Strawberries!

60
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.238
Grandpa! We're back!

61
00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.073
Peppa and George have
come to play again.

62
00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:39.142
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Did my plant grow?

63
00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.248
Yes! Look!

64
00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:42.515
Oooo!

65
00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:44.084
Strawberries!

66
00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:48.458
Thank you, Grandpa!

67
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.658
Grandpa, can We plant
something else?

68
00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:59.260
Yes! Now, it's George's
turn to choose.

69
00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:03.240
Yes! You choose, George.

70
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.272
Choose... a carrot!

71
00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:09.474
Grandpa, I think George
Wants to grow a carrot.

72
00:04:10.048 --> 00:04:13.108
George, Would you
like to grow a carrot?

73
00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:15.046
No!

74
00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.619
What Would you like to grow?

75
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:21.989
George has thought of
something he Wants to grow.

76
00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:26.252
Dine-Saw!

77
00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:29.559
George Wants to
grow a dinosaur tree!

78
00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:32.626
Silly George!

79
00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.295
Dinosaurs don't grow on trees.

80
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.308
Dine-saw. Grrrrr....

81
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:07.133
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
