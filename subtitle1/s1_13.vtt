00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:06.799
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:08.562
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.003
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.637
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.253
Flying a kite!

5
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.527
It is a bright, sunny day.
Peppa and her family are in the park.

6
00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.024
They are going to fly a kite!

7
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.596
George is going to fly the kite first.

8
00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:47.539
George runs as fast as he can.
But the kite Won't fly.

9
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.614
George! You're doing it
all Wrong!

10
00:00:56.923 --> 00:01:00.415
You didn't run fast enough.
Now, it's my turn!

11
00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.689
Peppa runs as fast as she can.

12
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.630
But the kite still Won't fly.

13
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.507
The kite Won't fly
if there isn't any Wind,

14
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.200
no matter how fast you run.

15
00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.444
Oh!

16
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.947
We'll just have to Wait,
until the Wind picks up a bit.

17
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.314
Oh!

18
00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.215
Look, it's getting Windy!

19
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.457
Now that it is Windy,
the kite can fly!

20
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.657
The Wind is quite strong now.

21
00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.600
The Wind is very strong now!

22
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.903
George!
Wahhh!

23
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.029
Peppa!

24
00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.468
Thank you, Daddy

25
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.339
Daddy Pig flies the kite.

26
00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.605
Hurray!

27
00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.178
Higher, higher!

28
00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.487
Daddy pig flies
the kite very Well.

29
00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:11.861
Wow!

30
00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:15.258
Yes, I am a bit of
an expert at these things

31
00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:22.505
Watch out for the trees!
You might get the kite stuck in one.

32
00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.207
Don't Worry;
I know What I'm doing.

33
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.379
Oh, dear. Daddy Pig has got
the kite caught in a tree.

34
00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:38.524
Oh, no!

35
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.519
Hmmm!

36
00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.396
Don't Worry, George.
Daddy Will get the kite down.

37
00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.655
Hurray!

38
00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.735
Err... yes.

39
00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.231
Careful! There's a
big muddy puddle!

40
00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.036
Peppa and George love
to jump in muddy puddles.

41
00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.111
Can We jump in the puddle?
Please!

42
00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.811
No. I don't Want you
covered in mud.

43
00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.179
Ohhhhhhhhh...

44
00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.380
Stand back, children.

45
00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.052
Please be careful, Daddy Pig!

46
00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:14.115
I know What I'm doing.

47
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.626
Please be careful!

48
00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:26.832
Just a bit further, Daddy!

49
00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:33.073
Daddy Pig, you are much too
heavy for that branch!

50
00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:39.141
Nonsense! I know
exactly how heavy I am. There!

51
00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:40.712
Hurray!

52
00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.520
Daddy Pig has rescued the kite!

53
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.852
Whoa!

54
00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.784
Oh, dear. Everyone is
covered in mud.

55
00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.154
It's only mud.

56
00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.363
Luckily, Daddy Pig hasn't hurt himself.

57
00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.801
And the kite is out of the tree!

58
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.302
Hurray!

59
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.238
Mummy... Now that We are all muddy,

60
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.970
can We jump in the puddle?

61
00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.474
I suppose so. After all,
you can't get any muddier...

62
00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.689
And I think Daddy Pig is going
to be doing the Washing...

63
00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:19.820
Oh!

64
00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:27.491
Peppa and George love jumping
up and down in muddy puddles!

65
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.766
Mummy and Daddy love jumping
up and down in muddy puddles.

66
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.831
Everyone loves jumping
up and down in muddy puddles!

67
00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:43.413
Jumping up and down in muddy puddles
is just as much fun as flying the kite!

68
00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:06.736
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
