00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:06.628
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.396
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.768
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.337
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.914
Daddy Gets Fit!

5
00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.282
Mummy Pig is Watching

6
00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.411
a keep fit program
on television.

7
00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.584
Come on, now, that's right.
bend it, stretch it,

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.594
bend it, stretch it.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.356
Ahhh!

I love Watching television.
and three and four

11
00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.290
What's this, Mummy Pig?
and one and two

12
00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.935
It's a program about
doing exercises to keep fit.

13
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.163
Thank goodness!

14
00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.934
I don't have to exercise!
I'm naturally fit.

15
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.936
You don't look very fit, Daddy;

16
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.113
your tummy is a bit big!

17
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.440
I'm very fit! I'll show you!

18
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.178
What shall I do first?

19
00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.682
Touch your toes. Like this!

20
00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.187
Easy!

21
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.188
Daddy! Stop pretending that
you can't touch your toes.

22
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.890
Err... I'm not
pretending, Peppa.

23
00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.194
Daddy Pig really cannot
touch his toes.

24
00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.126
Oh, dear, Daddy!
That's not very good!

25
00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.639
Hmmm... Maybe I should
do a bit of exercise.

26
00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.205
Yes, Daddy.

27
00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.841
And I Will start...
tomorrow!

28
00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.404
Daddy Pig! You have to
start exercising now!

29
00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:23.710
Oh!

30
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.713
Don't Worry, Daddy,
I Will help you.

31
00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:30.481
Oh, alright! Peppa, you're
in charge of getting me fit.

32
00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:31.917
What should I do first?

33
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.916
First, you must do
some press-ups!

34
00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:36.424
Easy!

35
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.228
One, two.

36
00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.226
There.

37
00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.494
Very good, Daddy.
Now, I Want you to do...

38
00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.999
One hundred!

39
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.669
One hundred?!

40
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.003
Yes.

41
00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.500
Come on, children,
help me make lunch.

42
00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:52.733
I'll help as Well.

43
00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:56.743
No, Daddy! You've got one
hundred press-ups to do.

44
00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:03.512
Oh. One...
Two...Three...

45
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.521
Mummy Pig, Peppa and George
Four...

46
00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.023
are in the kitchen making lunch.
Six...

47
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.251
Daddy Pig is still doing his press-ups.
Seven!...

48
00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.318
Daddy is doing
Eight!

49
00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.327
very Well.
Nine!...

50
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.095
Yes,
Ten!...

51
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.265
I do hope he's not overdoing it.
Eleven!...Twelve!...

52
00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.525
I'll go and see.

53
00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.036
Thirteen!... Fourteen!...

54
00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.541
Fifteen!...Sixteen!...
Seventeen!..

55
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.768
Daddy Pig! You're cheating!

56
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.271
You should be doing press-ups!

57
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.540
Oh! Err...

58
00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.774
There Was something
interesting on the Tv.

59
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.214
Naughty Daddy!

60
00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.545
Maybe Daddy Will
have more success

61
00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.722
With my old exercise bike.

62
00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:39.557
Aha! This looks like fun!

63
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.791
I'll be able to cycle and
Watch Tv at the same time.

64
00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.066
It's impossible!
This bike is too noisy.

65
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.065
I can't hear the Tv!

66
00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.437
You've got to get fit somehow.

67
00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.935
I know!
You can use my bicycle.

68
00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.008
Yes, and then you'll get some
fresh air as Well.

69
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.314
Daddy Pig is going to ride on
Peppa's little bicycle.

70
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.576
Daddy, these are the pedals.

71
00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.079
These are the brakes...
And this is the bell.

72
00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.816
Yes! Yes! Thank you, Peppa,
I know. Bye bye.

73
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.456
Easy as pie!

74
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.467
Getting fit is quite hard Work.

75
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.603
Aha! Now I can get fit
Without having to pedal!

76
00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.333
Daddy Pig is going very fast.

77
00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.111
Oh! Maybe I'd better slow down.

78
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.113
Arrgh! The brakes aren't strong enough!

79
00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.609
Help!

80
00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.063
Daddy Pig has been
gone for a long time.

81
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.359
Mummy, Where can Daddy be?

82
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.797
Don't Worry, Peppa.

83
00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.631
Daddy must be really
enjoying himself

84
00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.137
to be away for so long.

85
00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.638
Daddy! Where have you been?

86
00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.373
I Whizzed all the Way down the hill,

87
00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:15.382
and then I had to push the bike
all the Way back up again.

88
00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.089
Oh! Poor Daddy Pig!

89
00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.882
Well, at least I've done my exercise.

90
00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.659
Yes. For today.

91
00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:22.883
What do you mean?

92
00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.891
You'll have to do some
more exercise tomorrow.

93
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.025
What?

94
00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:31.336
Daddy, to get fit, you have
to exercise every day.

95
00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.328
Oh, no.

96
00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.665
But don't Worry, Daddy,
I'll make sure you do it.

97
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.401
Yes! I know you Will.

98
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.863
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

99
00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.596
This is Mummy Pig.

100
00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.070
And this is Daddy Pig.

101
00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.572
Peppa pig.

102
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.810
Tidying Up!

103
00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.887
Peppa and George are in their
bedroom playing With their toys.

104
00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.823
George, let's play dollies
and dinosaurs.

105
00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:31.889
Grrrrr...

106
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.761
What is that? It looks like
a horrible monster!
