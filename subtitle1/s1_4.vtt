I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:08.395
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.835
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.335
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.917
Best Friend.

5
00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.854
Peppa is Waiting for her
best friend, Suzy Sheep.

6
00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.657
Hello, Suzy!

7
00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:38.926
Baaaa! Hello, Peppa.

8
00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.663
Suzy Sheep has come to play With Peppa.

9
00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.573
Peppa loves Suzy.
Suzy loves Peppa.

10
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.314
They are best friends.

11
00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.089
Peppa, Why don't you and Suzy
go and play in your bedroom?

12
00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.891
Yes, Mummy!

13
00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.595
George Wants to play, too.

14
00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.267
Peppa and Suzy love
playing in Peppa's bedroom.

15
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.677
So does George.

16
00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.109
No, George.

17
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.475
This game is just for big girls.

18
00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.419
Go and play With your own toys.

19
00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:33.214
Peppa and Suzy Want to
play on their own.

20
00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.422
I'm a tiny little
fairy princess!

21
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.237
I'm going to
Wave my magic Wand...

22
00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.437
and turn you into a frog!

23
00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.739
George doesn't like playing on his own.

24
00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.251
George Wants to play, too.

25
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.948
No, George!
I'm playing With Suzy...

26
00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.250
You'll have to play
somewhere else.

27
00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.459
George Wants to play With Peppa.

28
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:14.758
He feels a bit Ionely.

29
00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.524
George, I need some help!!

30
00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.961
I'm making
chocolate chip cookies!!

31
00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.040
Someone needs to
lick out the bowl.

32
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.475
George likes helping Mummy
make cookies.

33
00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.479
But he likes playing With Peppa more.

34
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.283
Baaaa! I Want to be a nurse!

35
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.050
I Want to be a doctor.

36
00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.696
But Who's gonna be
the sick person?

37
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.799
GEORGe!!!

38
00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:58.366
Peppa and Suzy love playing
doctors and nurses.

39
00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.000
So does George.

40
00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:03.579
Peppa listens to George's chest.

41
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.517
Now, George, take a big breath in...

42
00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.013
then cough.

43
00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:14.323
Mm, I think your heart's
a bit loose...

44
00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:16.954
...I'll put a plaster on it.

45
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.093
Baa! Open Wide, please.

46
00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.326
Suzy takes George's temperature.

47
00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:27.396
Oh, dear, you're very, very hot.

48
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.339
I think you have to
stay in bed for three years.

49
00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.112
Daddy Pig has come to find George.

50
00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.047
Oh, no! What's Wrong With George?

51
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.611
Don't Worry, Daddy.
It's only a game.

52
00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.617
George is our patient.

53
00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.114
Oh, I see.

54
00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.855
Can the patient have a visitor?

55
00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:49.858
Just for a little While.

56
00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.121
He might get tired.

57
00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.060
Cookies!!!

58
00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.267
Yes, they're for George.

59
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.366
They're his medicine

60
00:03:58.637 --> 00:03:59.763
to make him feel better.

61
00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:09.041
Um, excuse me, doctor,

62
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.140
Can you help me?

63
00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:11.876
I have a sore tummy.

64
00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:14.784
That tickles!

65
00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:22.885
I can hear it rumbling.
I think you're hungry, Daddy.

66
00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.388
Then I think I need
lots of cookies to make me better.

67
00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:31.164
And me!

68
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.599
And me!

69
00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:33.968
And me! Baa

70
00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:06.764
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
