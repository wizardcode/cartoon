00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:06.971
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.839
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.335
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.837
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.151
Grandpa Pig's Boat

5
00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:23.644
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig
are taking Peppa and George

6
00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.653
out for a day on the river.

7
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.851
Welcome aboard, me hearties!

8
00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.719
Peppa, George, let's put
your life-jackets on.

9
00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.856
When Peppa and George are
on Grandpa Pig's boat,

10
00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:36.223
they must Wear life-jackets.

11
00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:39.794
On this boat,
I'm the captain.

12
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.166
Aye-aye, Captain!

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.298
Aye-aye, Captain!

14
00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:46.442
When Captain Grandpa tells
you all to do something,

15
00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.506
you must do it.

16
00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.582
Unless it's something silly.

17
00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.177
Captain Grandpa never says
anything silly.

18
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.311
Of course not, Captain Grandpa.

19
00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:00.189
George! Raise the flag!

20
00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.319
Peppa! Ring the bell!

21
00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.460
Aye-aye, Captain!

22
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.831
Granny Pig! Take the Wheel!

23
00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.331
Aye-aye, Captain!

24
00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.900
Full sail!

25
00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.476
Full sail!

26
00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.850
Maybe you should go
a little slower, Grandpa Pig.

27
00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:29.982
Good idea, Granny Pig.

28
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.721
I don't Want to
use up all my petrol.

29
00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:38.128
Grandpa, I liked it
When We Went fast.

30
00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.727
Don't Worry, Peppa,
We'll go fast later!

31
00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.429
Look! There's another boat!

32
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:45.935
Here's Granddad Dog.

33
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.066
He's taking Danny Dog
out for a day on the river.

34
00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.376
Ahoy there, Granddad Dog!

35
00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.144
Ahoy there, Grandpa Pig!

36
00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.436
Hello, Danny!!

37
00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:57.240
Hello, Peppa!

38
00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.752
Granddad Dog is Grandpa Pig's
very best friend.

39
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.757
I'm surprised
your boat is still afloat,

40
00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.463
Granddad Dog. It must be
almost as old as you are!

41
00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.756
Woof! This old boat can go

42
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.961
faster than your
rusty bucket any day,

43
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:17.965
Grandpa Pig.

44
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.266
Alright, you old sea-dog,
race you!

45
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:24.975
Prepare to lose, Water-hog!

46
00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.604
You two are acting
like little children!

47
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.280
Granddad Dog called me a Water-hog.

48
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.355
You called him a sea-dog first, Grandpa.

49
00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.113
You should say ''sorry''.

50
00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.790
Only if he says ''sorry'' first.

51
00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.058
Granddad, say ''sorry'' to Grandpa Pig.

52
00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.988
He is your best friend.

53
00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.565
No. He's a Water-hog and
my boat is faster than his.

54
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:56.498
Alright, sea-dog! Let's race
to the next bridge!

55
00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.503
On the count of three.

56
00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.942
One... Two...

57
00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.077
Go!!!

58
00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.510
You started too soon!

59
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.009
Catch me if you can,
Water-hog!

60
00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:08.950
Woof! Woof!

61
00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:16.887
Sea-dog!
ls that as fast as you can go?

62
00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:23.830
Can't catch me!
I Win!

63
00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:29.105
Oh, dear. Grandpa Pig's boat
has run out of petrol.

64
00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.607
Very clever, Captain Grandpa.

65
00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.478
Maybe I did go a bit too fast.

66
00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:36.480
How Will We get home?

67
00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.412
Look, there's Granddad Dog!

68
00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.844
Granddad Dog can tow us home!

69
00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.920
I'm not being towed
by that sea-dog.

70
00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.359
I haven't offered to tow
the Water-hog.

71
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.420
Will you two ever grow up?

72
00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.757
Grandpa, say ''sorry'' to Granddad Dog.

73
00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.505
I'm sorry I called you a sea-dog.

74
00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.640
Granddad, say ''sorry'' to Grandpa Pig.

75
00:04:04.443 --> 00:04:07.708
I'm sorry I called you a Water-hog.

76
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.007
That's nice. Granddad Dog,

77
00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:13.010
Would you be so kind as to tow us home?

78
00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:15.446
It Would be my pleasure, madam!

79
00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.515
Catch this, Captain!

80
00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.214
Aye-Aye, Skipper!

81
00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.590
Granddad Dog is Grandpa Pig's
very best friend!

82
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:23.954
Woof Woof!

83
00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.388
Granddad Dog is towing
Grandpa Pig's boat home.

84
00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:31.594
The main thing is
I Won the race.

85
00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:33.026

86
00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.237

Peppa and George are
going shopping!

95
00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:30.957
Peppa and George like shopping.

96
00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:35.028
George loves
sitting in the trolley.
