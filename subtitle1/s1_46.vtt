I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:08.899
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:11.402
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:14.937
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.711
Frogs and Worms and Butterflies!

5
00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.950
Peppa and George are helping
Grandpa Pig in his Garden.

6
00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:37.962
What a beautiful butterfly.

7
00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:45.105
Grandpa, Why do
butterflies like flowers?

8
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.244
They get their food from flowers.

9
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.446
How?

10
00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:51.738
They have very long tongues.

11
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.478
Longer than mine?

12
00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:01.254
Oh, yes, the butterfly's tongue
is even longer than yours.

13
00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:04.060
She uses it to drink from
the flower.

14
00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:06.127
Slurrrrp!

15
00:01:06.197 --> 00:01:06.754
Burp!

16
00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:10.495
Wow!

17
00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.265
Peppa, the
butterfly thinks you're a flower.

18
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.272
I'm not a flower!
I'm Peppa Pig!

19
00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:26.912
She is so pretty.
I Want to be a butterfly.

20
00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.016
Peppa is playing at being a butterfly.

21
00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:31.917
I'm a little butterfly.

22
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:34.519
George Wants to play, too.

23
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:41.288
George! I'm the butterfly!
You have to be something else.

24
00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:48.033
I know! You can be
a Wriggly Worm!

25
00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:54.034
Look! Look! I'm a butterfly.

26
00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.612
Oh, dear!
George does not Want to be a Worm.

27
00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.547
He Wants to be a butterfly.

28
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.819
George, When I Was a little piggy,

29
00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:09.191
I used to like playing at being a Worm.

30
00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:14.058
It's very easy to be a Worm.
I'll show you how.

31
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:18.967
First, you have to lie down on the ground.

32
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.334
Then, you Wriggle around.

33
00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:27.335
I'm a Wriggly Worm!

34
00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:34.574
George and Grandpa Pig
are having such fun

35
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:35.978
being Wriggly Worms.

36
00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.787
I'm a little butterfly,
I'm a little butterfly.

37
00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:48.158
Look! Grandpa! I'm a butterfly!

38
00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:51.861
Yes, Peppa, you're
a beautiful butterfly.

39
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.862
Grandpa! George!
What are you doing?

40
00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:58.507
We are Wriggly Worms.

41
00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:02.869
I Want to be a Wriggly Worm, too!

42
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:05.310
I'm a Wriggly Worm!

43
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:11.110
I'm a Wriggly Worm!

44
00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.382
I'm a Wriggly Worm, I'm a Wriggly Worm.

45
00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:18.188
How do you do? I love you!

46
00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.627
I'm a Wriggly Worm.

47
00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:28.902
That Was fun. What animal
do you Want to be now?

48
00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:31.534
Hmmm! I don't know.

49
00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:36.637
Look, Grandpa! There's a little frog!

50
00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.607
Why don't you play at being frogs?

51
00:03:41.652 --> 00:03:43.916
Hmmm, frogs are not
as pretty as butterflies

52
00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:46.415
or as Wriggly as Worms.

53
00:03:46.724 --> 00:03:49.420
But frogs do play a game you like.

54
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.424
Hmmm... do frogs play dolls' houses?

55
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.925
Silly Peppa.

56
00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.430
What's your favorite game?

57
00:03:57.668 --> 00:03:59.158
Jumping in muddy puddles!

58
00:04:00.438 --> 00:04:03.566
Yes! Frogs love jumping in
muddy puddles.

59
00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:09.375
Yes, George! Let's play frogs!

60
00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:12.644
I'm a little froggy!

61
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.082
I'm a little froggy!

62
00:04:21.692 --> 00:04:24.684
The froggies have found a nice
big muddy puddle to play in.

63
00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:27.959
Peppa and George love jumping
up and down in muddy puddles.

64
00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.457
Everyone loves jumping up and down
in muddy puddles.

65
00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:35.695
Butterflies and Worms are
very nice!

66
00:04:36.474 --> 00:04:38.465
But I like frogs the best!

67
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:07.294
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
