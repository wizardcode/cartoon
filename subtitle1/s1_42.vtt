00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:06.537
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:08.464
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:10.800
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.311
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.979
Chloe's Puppet Show!

5
00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.809
Peppa and her family are visiting

6
00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.547
Uncle Pig and Aunty Pig
and Cousin Chloe.

7
00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.692
I expect Uncle Pig Will
fall asleep after lunch,

8
00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:29.054
like he always does.

9
00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.056
Daddy Pig!

10
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.058
You shouldn't say such things
about your own brother!

11
00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.429
Especially in front of
the children.

12
00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:35.565
But it's true!

13
00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.065
Uncle Pig always eats too much
lunch and falls asleep,

14
00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:41.568
snoring Ioudly!
Like this.

15
00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:47.843
Err... Peppa, George,

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.578
forget What I just said
about Uncle Pig.

17
00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:51.847
Okay, Daddy!

18
00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.346
Peppa and her family
have arrived at

19
00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.854
Uncle Pig and Aunty Pig's house.

20
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:01.786
Hello, Aunty Pig and
Uncle Pig!

21
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:02.957
Hello!

22
00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:04.227
Hello, everyone!

23
00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.094
Hello, big brother!

24
00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:08.293
Uncle Pig is
Daddy Pig's brother.

25
00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.862
Chloe Pig is Peppa
and George's cousin.

26
00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.092
Hello, Chloe!

27
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:16.602
Hello, Peppa! Hello, George!
I Want to show you something!

28
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:17.864
Wait for us!

29
00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:26.550
This is my new puppet theater!
My daddy made it for me.

30
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.751
Wow!

31
00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:28.545
Ooo!

32
00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:33.119
I've made two puppets already!
This one is called Chloe!

33
00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.550
Hello! I am Chloe Pig.

34
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.763
And this one is my daddy.

35
00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:40.896
Uncle Pig!

36
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.124
Hello, Peppa!
I am Uncle Pig.

37
00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:50.564
Chloe? Can me and George
make puppets, too?

38
00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.403
Yes.

39
00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:55.903
Chloe paints
the puppet's eyes.

40
00:01:56.648 --> 00:01:57.842
Can I do the mouth?

41
00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:58.644
Ok.

42
00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.914
My name is Peppa!

43
00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.089
George? What puppet Would
you like to make?

44
00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.347
Dine-Saw!

45
00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:08.851
A dinosaur?

46
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.927
George always says
''dinosaur'' for everything.

47
00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:16.430
Ok, a scary dinosaur puppet.

48
00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.431
Chloe is making George
a dinosaur puppet.

49
00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:24.432
It needs pointy teeth.
There! A scary dinosaur.

50
00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.673
Grrrrrrrrrr!

51
00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:30.537

Hurray.

55
00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.180
Aunty Pig has made
spaghetti for lunch!

56
00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:45.128
This spaghetti is delicious!

57
00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.190
Best spaghetti ever!

58
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.892

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.197
Alike in everyway.

60
00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:54.700

A puppet show!
That sounds fun.

66
00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.980
Have I got time for
some more spaghetti?

67
00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:14.487
Could I have some more, too?

68
00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:20.728
The puppet show is about to begin!

69
00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:25.669
Hello! My name is Chloe.

I am Uncle Pig

75
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.014
Hello, Uncle Pig!

76
00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.519
Hello, Peppa!

77
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:47.517
It looks just like you!

78
00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.954
I think they've made
my tummy a bit big.

79
00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.129
I did enjoy my lunch!

80
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.533
Uncle Pig? Are you going to fall asleep

81
00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.027
and snore like you always do?

82
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.267
What do you mean?

83
00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:05.641
Daddy says you always fall asleep

84
00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:09.141
and snore Ioudly, like this.

85
00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:17.414
Your daddy's right.

86
00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:19.046
I do snore like this.

87
00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:23.226
Oh, Daddy Pig!

88
00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:25.291
You shouldn't have said those
things about Uncle Pig!

89
00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:28.990
I don't think Daddy Pig
or Uncle Pig can hear you!

90
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.928
Daddy Pig and Uncle Pig
have fallen asleep.

91
00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.000
You can tell they are brothers!

92
00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:37.066
Eh?! What happened?

93
00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.743
Ugh? Has the puppet
show started yet?
