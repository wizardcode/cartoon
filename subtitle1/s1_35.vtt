Peppa pig.

4
00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:19.943
Very Hot Day!

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.016
The sun is shining.
It is a very hot day.

Peppa and George are
Wearing their boots!

8
00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.091
They are going to jump
in muddy puddles!

9
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.094
I love muddy puddles.

10
00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:36.664
Oh!

11
00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.733
Oh, dear! The sun is so hot

12
00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.235
that the puddles have dried up!

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.329
Mummy! Daddy!

14
00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.111
The puddles are all dry and
We can't jump in them!

15
00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.676
Never mind, Peppa.
It's so sunny,

16
00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.175
you can play in the
paddling pool instead!

17
00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.244
Yes! The paddling pool!

18
00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:57.187
First, you have to change into
your swimming costumes.

19
00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.482
Yes, Mummy.

20
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.757

And Daddy Pig is Wearing his
swimming costume!

23
00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:15.505
Because it's so hot,
you need sun cream.

24
00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:21.871
It's all
oily and yucky!

25
00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:26.279
Yuck!

26
00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:29.376

Yes, We all need
sun cream today.

28
00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.017
Oh!

29
00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:40.393
Come on, George.

30
00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.798
Let's get some air into
this paddling pool!

31
00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:47.903
Daddy Pig is pumping up
the paddling pool!

32
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.908
Easy as pie!

33
00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.248
Peppa holds the hose
and Mummy Pig turns on the Water.

34
00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:07.923

And What Would young

Dine-Saw!

56
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:10.053
A dinosaur?

57
00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.621
Silly George!

58
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.756
He always says
''dinosaur'' for everything!

59
00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:17.759
Well, it just so happens

60
00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:20.897
that I do have a
dinosaur shaped ice-Iolly!

61
00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:25.396
Dine-Saw! Grrrr!

62
00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:26.262
George,

63
00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.498
you should eat your
ice-Iolly before it melts.

64
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:30.403
Dine-Saw.

65
00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.007
George loves his dinosaur
ice-Iolly so much,

66
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:34.142
he doesn't Want to eat it.

67

Enjoy the Weather!

69
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:41.915
George, I really think you
should eat your ice-Iolly

70
00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:46.148
before it melts and...
falls on the ground.

71
00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:50.524
Oh, dear, George's dinosaur
ice-Iolly has melted

72
00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:51.356

73
00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:54.732
Come on, George.
You can share Daddy's ice cream.

74
00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:56.091
I'm sure he Won't mind.

75
00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:01.670

76
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.237
Daddy Pig has fallen asleep!

77
00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.099
Daddy Pig does look hot!

78
00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:08.038
Let's tip Water on Daddy
to cool him down!

79
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.438
Good idea, Peppa!

80
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.883
What happened?!!!

81
00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:15.176
You Were all red

82
00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:17.184

83
00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:20.120

84
00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:26.058
Look! The puddles are back!

85
00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.699

86
00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:35.706
Peppa and George are
Wearing their boots!

87
00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:39.401
Peppa and George love the hot day.

88
00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:40.467
But most of all,

89
00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.580
they love jumping up
and down in puddles!

90
00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:06.537
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

91
00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:08.464
This is Mummy Pig.

92
00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:10.800

I expect Uncle Pig Will
fall asleep after lunch,

98
00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.054
like he always does.

99
00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.056
Daddy Pig!

100
00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.058
You shouldn't say such things
about your own brother!

101
00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.429
Especially in front of
the children.

102
00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:35.565
But it's true!
