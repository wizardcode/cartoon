00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.926
Peppa and George are
having a picnic.

juice for you, Teddy.

15
00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.017
Would Teddy or Mr. Dinosaur
like a cookie?

16
00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.778
We're not very hungry.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.285
So Peppa and George can
eat all the cookies.

18
00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.022
Thank you, Teddy.

19
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.660
What Was that strange noise?

20
00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.036
Peppa, George! Quick,
come inside the house!

21
00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.534
Mummy! There Was
a loud ''bang'' sound!

22
00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.303
It's thunder, Peppa.

23
00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.983
It means there Will be
a thunderstorm With lots of rain.

24
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.246
Quick! lnto the house
before the rain starts!

25
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.253
No need to panic,

26
00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.749
the rain is still a long Way off.

27
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.254
The sky is getting darker and darker.

28
00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.325
There is going to be a thunderstorm.

29
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.057
Peppa, George,

30
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.561

toys in from the garden?

31
00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.061
Dine-Saw.

32
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.835
Good, Mr. Dinosaur is safe.

33
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.776
Teddy! I left Teddy in the garden!

34
00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.070
He'll get Wet!

35
00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:55.403

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.072
Daddy Pig Will rescue Teddy!

37
00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.075
You'd better hurry,

38
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.513
Daddy Pig. It's
just about to rain!

39
00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.778
I know all about thunderstorms.

40
00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.851
It Won't rain for ages.

41
00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.522
As I thought,

42
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.861
plenty of time
before it rains.

43
00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.867
Poor Teddy!
He's soaking Wet!

44
00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:29.047

The rain is
coming in the house!

53
00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.350
The floor is getting Wet!

54
00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.419
Oh, dear! What can We do,
Daddy Pig?

55
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.651
Don't Worry.

56
00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.291
Daddy Pig is using a bucket
to catch the drips.

57
00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.084
Well-done, Daddy Pig!

58
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.432
Easy as pie!
Er? What?

59
00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.362
Quick! Find something else
to catch the Water!

60
00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:29.600
Well-done, Peppa!

61
00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.603
Easy as pie!

62
00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.513
Mummy! The thunder
bangs are very loud!

63
00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.444
It's okay, children;
don't be frightened.

64
00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.186
Let's count between
each flash and bang.

65
00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.692
The higher We can count,

66
00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.451
the further away
the thunderstorm is.

67
00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:55.027
One... two...
three...

68
00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:58.895
That's three.

69
00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:07.208
One... two... three...
four... five...

70
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.473
That's five!

71
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.475
The thunderstorm is going away!

72
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.979
The thunderstorm is over!

73
00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.213
Hurray!

74
00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.427
The thunderstorm
has filled the garden

75
00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.723
With muddy puddles!

76
00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.560
Peppa loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles.

77
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.665
Everyone loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles.

78
00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.005
I love thunderstorms,

79
00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.376

80
00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.008
Splish, splash, splosh, splish!
