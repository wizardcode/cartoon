00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.201
Peppa pig.

ball in the garden.

all Wrong!

little one, pig Peppa is.

George! Come back!
You little piggy!

13
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.091
Maybe Peppa is teasing George
just a bit too much.

14
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.656
Peppa, have you
been teasing George?

15
00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.595
Not really, Mummy, I Was
teaching him how to catch.

It's called ''Piggy-in-the-Middle''.

19
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.675
Peppa, you take the ball
and stand over there

20
00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.876

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.743
and I have to try and catch it.

23
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.678

33
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.045
