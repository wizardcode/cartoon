00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.826
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:08.596
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:11.033
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:14.406
Peppa Pig.

4
00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:21.981
Bicycles!

5
00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:26.548
It is a Iovely, sunny day,

6
00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:28.985
and Peppa and George are
riding their bicycles.

7
00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:35.124
That's a fine pumpkin,
Daddy Pig!

8
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.126
Daddy Pig is very proud of
his pumpkin.

9
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.633
Pumpkins are the only thing
I can grow.

10
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:43.362
Probably because
I love pumpkin pie!

11
00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.069
Come on, George.

12
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.142
Danny, Suzy, Rebecca!

13
00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:50.573
Peppa and her friends,

14
00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:53.216
Danny Dog, Suzy Sheep
and Rebecca Rabbit,

15
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:54.577
are riding their bicycles.

16
00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.580
George is riding his tricycle.

17
00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:58.252
He's going so slowly.

18
00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.890
Let's race to
Daddy Pig's pumpkin.

19
00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:07.153
lf We race to Daddy's Pumpkin,

20
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.898
We have to be very careful
not to bump into it.

21
00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:14.668
Daddy Would be very sad
if the pumpkin got broken.

22
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.165
Don't Worry, Peppa..

23
00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:18.101
Race you!

24
00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.174
Peppa and her friends are
racing to Daddy Pig's pumpkin!

25
00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:23.974
Hey! Watch out for my pumpkin!!

26
00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:26.408
Hurray!

27
00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:32.420
Peppa! Look out!
Daddy's Pumpkin!!!!

28
00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:35.421
Sorry, Daddy!

29
00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:40.419
Look at George!
He's going so slowly!

30
00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:44.628
George is still
riding a baby bike!

31
00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:48.934
Yours is
a baby bike, too, Peppa!

32
00:01:49.073 --> 00:01:50.700
You've still got stabilizers!

33
00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:54.134
I can ride Without my stabilizers.

34
00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.211
Me, too.

35
00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:57.942
And me.

36
00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:01.881
Let's ride up the hill again!

37
00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:04.213
Are you coming, Peppa?

38
00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:06.320
No, I think I'll stay here.

39
00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.826
See you later!
Bye!

40
00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:15.455
Peppa Wishes she did not have
stabilizers on her bicycle.

41
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.666
Daddy, I don't Want stabilizers anymore.

42
00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:21.834
Do you think you can ride
Without them?

43
00:02:22.473 --> 00:02:23.098
Yes.

44
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.971
Alright, Peppa. Let's take them off.

45
00:02:26.844 --> 00:02:29.176
Daddy Pig is taking the stabilizers
off Peppa's bicycle.

46
00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:33.681
Are you sure you Want to
ride Without stabilizers?

47
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:34.545
Yes!

48
00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:36.610
You've never done it before.

49
00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:39.179
I can do it. I can! I can!

50
00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:42.186
Arrgh!

51
00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:46.189
It's not funny!

52
00:02:46.764 --> 00:02:48.823
Riding Without stabilizers
is not easy.

53
00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:51.061
Would you like some help,
Peppa?

54
00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:52.696
Yes, please, Daddy.

55
00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:55.563
Alright. Ready...

56
00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:57.768
Steady... Go!

57
00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:59.703
Don't let go, Daddy!

58
00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:02.074
Don't Worry. I've got you.

59
00:03:03.147 --> 00:03:05.206
You're doing really Well, Peppa.

60
00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:08.146
Hold on, Daddy!

61
00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:11.280
Just keep peddling.

62
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.286
Peppa is riding on her own,
Without stabilizers!

63
00:03:17.228 --> 00:03:19.219
Daddy! You let go!

64
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:23.522
You've been cycling
on your own for ages.

65
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:24.595
Have I?

66
00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:27.162
You're really very good at it!

67
00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:28.098
Am I?

68
00:03:29.373 --> 00:03:31.898
Oh, I can do it! Look at me!

69
00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.170
Look at me! I can ride my bike properly.

70
00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:40.540
Danny! Suzy! Rebecca! Look!

71
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.814
I don't need my stabilizers
anymore! Look at me!

72
00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:47.114
Hurray!

73
00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.686
Race you to Daddy's pumpkin!

74
00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:55.554
Wheeeee!

75
00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:57.700
Peppa, look out my pumpkin!

76
00:03:58.636 --> 00:03:59.830
I'm going to Win!

77
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:01.833
Peppa isn't looking
Where she is going!

78
00:04:05.776 --> 00:04:08.074
Wahhhh! Oops!

79
00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:11.573
Oh, dear, Peppa has squashed
Daddy Pig's pumpkin!

80
00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:15.775
Sorry I squashed
your pumpkin, Daddy.

81
00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:17.345
Never mind the pumpkin.

82
00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:20.287
The important thing is
that you are okay.

83
00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:23.218
ln future, you really must look
Where you are going.

84
00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:25.785
I promise I Will, Daddy.

85
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.090
Good. Anyway,
now the pumpkin is broken,

86
00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:31.798
I can make it
into pumpkin pie!

87
00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:34.234
I love pumpkin pie!

88
00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:37.863
And because Daddy Pig's
pumpkin is so big,

89
00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:40.870
there Will be enough
pumpkin pie for everyone!

90
00:04:41.178 --> 00:04:42.805
Hurray!
