00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.800
Sports Day

2
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Today is the school sports day.

3
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.000
Peppa and herfriends are all here.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.100
The first event is running.

5
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.800
The children have to run
as fast us they can.

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.100
I think I will win.

7
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.600
I can run very fast.

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800
I'm faster than you.

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.900
Ready... Steady... Go.

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.600
I can run at a hundred miles an hour.

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.300
I can run at a million miles an hour.

12
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.900
Peppa. Suzy.
Stop talking and run.

13
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900
Oh.

14
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
Rebecca Rabbit is in the lead.

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Oh, dear!

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
Peppa and Suzy are right at the back.

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.400
Come on, Rebecca! Come on, Danny.
Come on, Peppa! Come on, Suzy!

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.900
Rebecca Rabbit wins.

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.700
And Peppa and Suzy are last.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.500
The winner of the race
is Rebecca Rabbit.

21
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Hooray.

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.900
Thank you.

23
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.600
I would have won
if you hadn't been talking to me, Suzy.

24
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.200
Now, now, Pepaa.

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.500
Remember,
it's not winning that matters,

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.100
but taking part.

27
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.700
Yes, Daddy.

28
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.300
The next event is the long jump.

29
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.800
George and Richard have to see
who can jump the furthest.

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.600
George, run as fast as you can,

31
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.100
then jump as far as you can.

32
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.083
George, ready... steady... Go!

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300
George has jumped as far as he can.

34
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.283
Now, it's Richard Rabbit's turn.

35
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.400
If Richard doesn't run,

36
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.700
he won't jump very far.

37
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.700
Richard Rabbit, Ready... Steady... Go.

38
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.200
Richard Rabbit has jumped
further than George.

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.300
And the winner is Richard Rabbit.

40
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.800
Hooray!!!

41
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.400
Waaaaaaa!

42
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.000
George, remember,

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.100
it's not the winning that matters,

44
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.500
but taking part.

45
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400
The next race is the relay.

46
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.400
Each child needs to
pick a parent to race.

47
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700
Peppa, pick me, pick me.

48
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.200
But Daddy,
You're not very good at running.

49
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.600
I was very good
when I was a little piggy.

50
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.600
But now you have a big tummy.

51
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.600
But I can still touch my toes nearly.

52
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.300
All right, Daddy.

53
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.200
But you must run very fast.

54
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.800
The Mummies and Daddies
will run the first part of the race.

55
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.500
And then hand the batons
to the children.

56
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
Mummies and Daddies.

57
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.900
Ready? Steady, Go!

58
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.700
RUN, Daddy. Mummy.

59
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.900
Daddy Pig is in the lead.

60
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.700
Come on, Daddy, Mummy.

61
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.100
Come on Daddy.

62
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.300
Thank you, Daddy.

63
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.600
You did very well.

64
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.500
Now, it's my turn to take the baton.

65
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.400
Peppa, stop talking and run.

66
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.383
Oh.

67
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.300
Keep running, go on.

68
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.900
And the winner is Emily Elephant.

69
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.400
Hooray.

70
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.700
Oh, Daddy,
I haven't won a prize yet.

71
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.200
Don't worry, Peppa.

72
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.300
There's still one more event.

73
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.800
And now for the last event of the day.

74
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.600
The tug of war.

75
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.300
Boys are against girls.

76
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.283
When I say go, you must
pull the rope with all yourstrength.

77
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.400
The girls will win.

78
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.000
No, they won't. The boys will win.

79
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.700
Ready! Steady! Go!

80
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.600
Come on, boys.

81
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.700
Come on, pull.

82
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.000
Come on, the girls, pull.

83
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.300
I am pulling.

84
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.283
Everyone is pulling so hard
the rope is breaking.

85
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.800
And the result is a draw.

86
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800
So both teams win.

87
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.700
Hooray.

88
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.100
I love the school sports day.

89
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.083
Especially when I win a prize.
