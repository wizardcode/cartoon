Mysteries

2
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.083
Peppa and herfamily are watching their
favorite television program, Detective Potato.

3
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.100
I am Detective Potato,
the world famous detective.

4
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.700
Oh!

5
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.600
Please help me, Mr. Detective.

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.800
I can not find my floweranywhere.

7
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.200
Humm, yourflower is on the top of your head.

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.900
Oh, thank you, Mr. Detective.

9
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.700
That was easy. I can do that.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900
Haha, I. M sure you could, peppa.

11
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.700
Daddy, when I grow up,
I want to be a famous detective.

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.100
George wants to be a detective, too.

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.500
If you're going to be detectives,
you each need a hat.

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Detectives always wear hats.

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.700
Now you look like two properdetectives.

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.300
And we need one of those funny things
that makes everything look big?

17
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
A magnifying glass.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.000
I think we've got one
in the kitchen drawer.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here they are.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.200
A real magnifying glass.

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.000
Wow! How does it work?

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500
You hold it in front of things,
and they look bigger.

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.300
The magnifying glass
makes the little fish look big.

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.800
Can I have a go?

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.400
Wow!

26
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.383
The magnifying glass makes
George's eyes look very big.

27
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.500
Now what you detectives need
is a mystery to solve.

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.300
Daddy, what is a "miss story'?

29
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.600
A mystery is something detectives
are good at sorting out,

30
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.500
like finding things that are lost.

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.300
I know,
we can find George's toy dinosaur.

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.000
That's always getting lost.

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.800
Dinosaur.

34
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.200
Mr. Dinosaur is not lost.

35
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.183
What about your glasses, daddy?
You. Re always losing them.

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.000
Not today,
I'm wearing my glasses.

37
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.400
It's not fair.

38
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.200
There aren't any "miss stories".

39
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.700
Would you like me to make you a mystery?

40
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.200
Yes, please.

41
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.000
Daddy Pig is going to make a mystery.

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
Now, what's on the table?

43
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.383
The little fish, teddy,
a Jackin the box and Mr. Dinosaur.

44
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.900
That. S right.

45
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.900
Now look very hard and try to remember them all.

46
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.900
The little fish, teddy,
a Jackin the box and Mr. Dinosaur.

47
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.500
Have you remembered them?

48
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.900
Yes!

49
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.400
Ok!

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100
You just have to go outside for a moment.

51
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.900
I'll call you when I'm ready.

52
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.883
It sounds like daddy is going upstairs.

53
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.300
And now he is coming down again.

54
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.400
All right, you can come back inside now.

55
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.900
One thing is missing from the table.

56
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.300
Do you know what?

57
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.000
Mr. Dinosaur is there,
little fish, Jack in the box.

58
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.100
So who's missing?

59
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.200
Humm, Teddy.

60
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.500
That. S right.

61
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.700
Teddy's gone.

62
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.000
Well done, Peppa and George.

63
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.400
It was quite easy for us.
We're famous detectives.

64
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.200
Ah, but that. S only half the mystery.

65
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.900
Where has teddy gone?

66
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.300
Oh, I don't know.

67
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.200
What are those little things on the floor?

68
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.300
The cake crumbs.

69
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.200
The magnifying glass makes the cake
crumbs easy to see.

70
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.300
I wonder if teddy has been eating cake.

71
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.700
And the crumbs lead this way.

72
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.100
Teddy's been eating a lot of cake.

73
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.000
The crumbs lead into
Peppa and George's bedroom.

74
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.700
Oh, the crumbs have stopped.

75
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.700
How could we find teddy?

76
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.000
Ask me some questions.

77
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.700
But I would only answeryes or no.

78
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.900
Ok, humm, is teddy in this room?

79
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.700
Yes.

80
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.900
Is teddy in George's bed?

81
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.900
No.

82
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.400
Is teddy some where high up?

83
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.900
Yes.

84
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.600
Teddy's in my bed.

85
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.100
Hooray!

86
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.600
The mystery is solved.

87
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
Do you still want to be a detective
when you grow up, Peppa?

88
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.000
Being a detective is quite hard.

89
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.100
Next time, I want to be the one
who makes mysteries.

90
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.083
Like you. Dear daddy.
