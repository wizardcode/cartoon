00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.900
My daddy mended our computer at home.

81
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.300

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.700
Good, Then this is job for Daddy Pig.

84
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.200
Um, maybe if I just switch it off.

85
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.400
And then switch it on again.

86
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.700
Grandpa Pig has mended the carwash.

87
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.400
