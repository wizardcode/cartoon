00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:18.995
Grandpa's Little Train

2
00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:21.833
Peppa and George
have come to play

3
00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:23.432
in Granny and Grandpa's garden.

4
00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:26.674
What's that noise?

5
00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.578
Grandpa's making something.

6
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.411
Hello, Peppa and George!

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.578
That's perfect timing.

8
00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.088
I've just finished making it!

9
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:38.624
And may we ask what "it" is?

10
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.286
I'll show you!

11
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.965
Wow!

12
00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:48.030
A Little toy train!

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.136
It's not a toy.

14
00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:51.863
This is "Gertrude".

15
00:00:51.983 --> 00:00:55.202
She's a miniature locomotive.

16
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.672
But doesn't it need
railway tracks to run on?

17
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.745
Oh no.

18
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.439
I've fitted Gertrude
with car wheels,

19
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:05.075
so she can go
anywhere she likes.

20
00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.112
Grandpa,
can we ride in Gertrude?

21
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.448
Hop aboard!

22
00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.186
Full steam ahead!

23
00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.556
Bye bye, Granny!

24
00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:15.788
See you later!

25
00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:19.159
Peppa and George love
Grandpa's Little train.

26
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.091
Grandpa's train goes:

27
00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:22.498
Choo choo choo!

28
00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:23.865
Choo choo choo!

29
00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:25.165
Choo choo choo!

30
00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:26.534
Grandpa's train goes:

31
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:27.868
Choo choo choo!

32
00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:30.534
All day Long!

33
00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.074
And the piggies on the train go:

34
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.475
Oink oink oink!

35
00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:34.741
Oink oink oink!

36
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.815
Oink oink oink!

37
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:37.417
And the piggies on the train go:

38
00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:38.779
Oink oink oink!

39
00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:41.115
All day Long!

40
00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:46.420
Here is Granddad Dog
with Danny Dog.

41
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:48.021
Hello!

42
00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:49.521
Hello, Danny!

43
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:52.895
I see you're playing toy trains.

44
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:56.299
Toy?! Gertrude isn't a toy!

45
00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.569
How. S your Little lorry?

46
00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:01.265
Little lorry?!

47
00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:05.675
My "breakdown truck"
is a proper, work vehicle.

48
00:02:06.558 --> 00:02:09.072
Granddad?
Can I ride on the train?

49
00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:11.276
Hmm.
It's yourchoice, Danny,

50
00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.751
if you'd rather
play trains than...

51
00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:15.218
Thanks Granddad!

52
00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.524
See you later!

53
00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:22.194
Miss Rabbit is
driving the school bus.

54
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.728
And to our left,

55
00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.891
we can see
some hills with trees...

56
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.392
Hello, everyone!

57
00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:30.594
Hello, Peppa!

58
00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.501
All Peppa's friends are here.

59
00:02:32.617 --> 00:02:34.573
Can we ride on the train?

60
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.244
Um. I'm giving the children
an educational bus tour.

61
00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:42.178
Are trains educational?

62
00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.376
They certainly are!

63
00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.884
Hmm. Hands up,

64
00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:48.716
all those who
want to ride on the train.

65
00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:50.290
Me! Me! Me!

66
00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:51.356
And hands up,

67
00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.949
all those who want to
stay on the bus.

68
00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:58.086
Ok, you can
all go on the train.

69
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.166
And I'll follow along behind.

70
00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:03.865
Grandpa's train goes:

71
00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:05.199
Choo choo choo!

72
00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:06.534
Choo choo choo!

73
00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:07.902
Choo choo choo!

74
00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.270
Grandpa's train goes:

75
00:03:09.387 --> 00:03:10.604
Choo choo choo!

76
00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:13.145
All day long!

77
00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:15.645
What a lot of mud!

78
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.081
We don't want to get stuck.

79
00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.346
Maybe we should
go a different way.

80
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.581
It's only a patch of mud.

81
00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:26.021
Come on, Gertrude!
You can make it!

82
00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:28.624
Come on, bus! You can make it!

83
00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:32.598
The bus is stuck in the mud.

84
00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:33.824
Oh bother!

85
00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:38.365
Hello, Miss Rabbit!
How are you today?

86
00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:41.566
I'm a bit stuck.
Can you rescue me?

87
00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:42.573
Certainly!

88
00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:46.168
Is yourtruck strong enough?

89
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:47.337
Trust me.

90
00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:53.713
Did it work?

91
00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:55.220
Er. No.

92
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:58.882
We need a vehicle
with more power...

93
00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.456
Can I help in any way?

94
00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:03.723
Er, it's nothing
that I can't deal with.

95
00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.127
Thanks anyway.

96
00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:06.665
I've got an idea!

97
00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:09.997
Grandpa Pig's train
can tow me out of the mud!

98
00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.471
Er. Good thinking,
Miss Rabbit.

99
00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:17.134
Grandpa's Little train is going
to pull the bus out of the mud.

100
00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.036
Full steam!

101
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.243
Come on, Gertrude!

102
00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.975
Come on, Gertrude!!!

103
00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:25.647
Horray!

104
00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:27.547
Well done!

105
00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:31.420
It's amazing what
can be done by a toy train!!

106
00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:35.961
Toy!!? Gertrude isn't a toy!

107
00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:40.522
Gertrude is the very best train
in the whole world!
