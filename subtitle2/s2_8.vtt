00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300
Windy Autumn Day

2
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.700
Today, Peppa is going to the park.

3
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
Brrr! Lt's freezing cold!

4
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.600
It is cold!

5
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.500
Quick!
Let's get our warm clothes on!

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.900
On cold days, Peppa and her family
wear their hats and scarves and coats.

7
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.800
I'll put the roof up.

8
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800
Ooh, And let's get the heating on.

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.500
Everyone nice and warm?

10
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.700
Yes, Daddy Pig!

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.600
Then let's go!

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.800
This is the park.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.200
We're here! Hooray!

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.600
Mummy,
why are all the leave red and yellow?

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
It's Autumn time, Peppa.

16
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.583
In the Autumn, it gets a bit colder
and the leaves change color.

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.400
It's quite windy.

18
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.383
Let's play a game to keep warm.

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200
My turn!

20
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
Oh,
it's not meant to go that away.

21
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.783
The wind is blowing the ball along!

22
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.800
The ball is in the pond!

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.700
Hmmm,
I'lljust use this stick to reach it.

24
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.500
Just a bit further, Daddy.

25
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.700
Be careful, Daddy Pig

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.100
Don't worry!
I. Ve almost got it.

27
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.000
Whoa!

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.700
Daddy, is the water cold?

29
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.100
A little bit.

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.900
The wind has blown the ball
out of the pond.

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.300
That's lucky!

32
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes, what a stroke of luck!

33
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.983
It's getting even windier,
Hold onto your hats.

34
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
Oh no!
The wind has blown George's hat off.

35
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.000
Whoa!

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.200
Don't worry George!

37
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500
Daddy Pig will catch your hat!

38
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.483
Quick, Daddy!

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.700
Look!
It's in that little tree!

40
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.200
Hmmm.
I'lljust climb up and get it.

41
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.600
The tree's much too thin to
take yourweight, Daddy Pig!

42
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.300
So, how can we get George's hat?

43
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.283
Simple,
I. II give the tree a little shake.

44
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.900
Hmmm, Maybe if I shake it a bit harder.

45
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.883
Oooh!

46
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.400
I thought that sort of thing
only happened to me!

47
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.000
It's not funny.

48
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300
It's a bit funny, Mummy.

49
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.600
I suppose it is a bit funny.

50
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.200
Where's George's hat?

51
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
It's on your head!

52
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.600
Here's your hat George!

53
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.800
Hold onto it this time!

54
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.100
The wind is blowing all the leaves
off the trees.

55
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.400
Look at me! I'm living into the wind.

56
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.000
The wind is strong enough
to hold Peppa up!

57
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600
The wind is strong enough
to hold George up!

58
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
Daddy! Have a go!

59
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.800
Er. I'm a bit too heavy...

60
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.900
Come on, Daddy!
It's really fun!

61
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.800
Oh, all right!

62
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.000
The wind is strong enough
to hold up Daddy Pig!

63
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.800
I say! This is fun!

64
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.500
Come on, Mummy Pig!
Give it a try!

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.300
But if the wind stops.
I'll fall over.

66
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.000
The wind won't just stop!

67
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.900
The wind has stopped.

68
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.300
It's not funny!

69
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.100
It is a bit funny!

70
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.700
Now, the wind has stopped.
What can we do?

71
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.300
Hmm, What's you favourite game?

72
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.100
Jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

73
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.400
But there aren't any puddles.

74
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.300
Just lots If boring, dry leaves.

75
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.300
And what do you do with dry leaves?

76
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.900
I don't know.

77
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.600
Jump up and down in them!

78
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.900
Daddy Pig loves
jumping up and down in leaves.

79
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.700
Peppa loves
jumping up and down in leaves.

80
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.200
Everyone loves
jumping up and down in leaves.

81
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.183
This is the best Autumn day ever!
