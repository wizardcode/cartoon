00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
Traffic Jam

2
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.100
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are
making lunch for Peppa and her family.

3
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.600
I've dug up some more potatoes.

4
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.100
Oh, Grandpa.

5
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.400
We're already got
plenty of potatoes.

6
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.600
You can never have
too many potatoes.

7
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Ok, But get the potatoes
in the oven,

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.100
The others will be here soon.

9
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.900
Hoho, we've plenty of time.

10
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.400
It's only eleven o'clock.

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.000
Peppa and herfamily
are on their way.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
I wish we'd set off sooner.

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.400
We're going to be late again.

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.300
Don't worry. Mummy Pig.

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.700
We've still got loads of time.

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.700
We're always late when we
go to Granny and Grandpa's.

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.000
Not this time.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.800
I've found a new way,

19
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.400
that avoids all the traffic.

20
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.200
Oh, I wasn't expecting that.

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Peppa and herfamily
are stuck in a traffic Jam.

22
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
Look, there's Danny Dog
and Granddad Dog.

23
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
Danny Dog and Granddad Dog
are in the traffic jam, too.

24
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.500
Hello, Peppa.

25
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.200
We're going to my Granny
and Grandpa's for lunch.

26
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.800
We're going to be late.

27
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.600
It's one o'clock.

28
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.100
They're late as usual.

29
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.300
How are your potatoes doing?

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.283
Er. They still need
a bit more cooking.

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.400
Granny Pig speaking.

32
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.900
Hello, Granny Pig.

33
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.200
We're stuck in a traffic jam.

34
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.000
Don't worry,

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
we're running late, too.

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.500
Grandpa's gone over
the top with potatoes.

37
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.100
See you in a bit.

38
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.300
The poor dears are
stuck in a traffic jam.

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.500
Sounds like I've got time to
get a few more potatoes.

40
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.100
Grandpa Pig!

41
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.100
We're moving so slowly.

42
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.200
We'll neverget to
Granny and grandpa's.

43
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
Peppa's right.

44
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.800
We have to try
a different way.

45
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.000
But there aren't
any other main roads.

46
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.600
I know a shortcut.

47
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.900
Bye bye, everyone!

48
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.000
We're taking a shortcut.

49
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.300
Bye bye, Peppa.

50
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.500
Good luck!

51
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.300
Mummy Pig is taking a shortcut
to get ahead of the traffic.

52
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300
The shortcut is very bumpy.

53
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.600
This is fun.

54
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.200
Are you sure about this?

55
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
Trust me.

56
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.300
Hello, ducks.

57
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.283
We're taking a shortcut.

58
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.100
Look! There's the main road again.

59
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.500
Well done! Mummy Pig.

60
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.700
But we've still
behind Danny's lorry.

61
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.200
Hello, welcome back!

62
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
Oh, dear!

63
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.183
Mummy Pig's shortcut
has not worked very well.

64
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.300
Good! Lunch is ready.

65
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.900
And most important of all:
The potatoes are done!

66
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.100
Lunch is ready.

67
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.083
But Peppa and herfamily
are still not here.

68
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.500
Grandpa Pig speaking.

69
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.900
We're almost at your house.

70
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.600
But the traffic is still moving
at the speed of a snail.

71
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.600
A very, very slow snail.

72
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.100
They're almost here.

73
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.300
But they're still
in the traffic jam.

74
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.100
Poordears.

75
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.400
The food is going to get cold.

76
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.300
I've got an idea.

77
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.800
I'll get my wheelbarrow.

78
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.900
What is Grandpa Pig doing?

79
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.500
Granny Pig!

80
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.100
Load the lunch
into the wheelbarrow.

81
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.800
Aye, aye, Grandpa Pig.

82
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.200
If they can't come to the lunch.

83
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.900
We have to take the lunch to them.

84
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.883
Look! There's Granny and Grandpa
with our lunch in a wheelbarrow.

85
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.100
Ahoy, there!

86
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.800
Lunch is served.

87
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.500
Is there enough for Danny and
Granddad Dog to have some, too?

88
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
We've got enough foreveryone.

89
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.400
Hooray! Potatoes.

90
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.800
Good job!

91
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.000
You did lots and
lots of potatoes, Grandpa.

92
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.983
You can never have
too many potatoes.
