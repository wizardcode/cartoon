The Balloon Ride

2
00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.440
It is the day
of the school fete.

3
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.167
Miss Rabbit is
running the raffle.

4
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.642
Roll up, roll up!

5
00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.839
The top prize is a ride
in my hot air balloon.

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.973
Wow, that sounds fun!

7
00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.585
Can I have a ticket, please?

8
00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:36.922
The blue ticket wins...

9
00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:39.991
A toy car! Well done, Danny!

10
00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:42.721
Can I have a ticket, please?

11
00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:43.854
Thank you, Peppa.

12
00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.261
What are you hoping to win?

13
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.491
The Balloon Ride!

14
00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.435
Wouldn't it be nicer to win
the homemade chocolate cake?

15
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.699
Daddy Pig loves
homemade chocolate cake.

16
00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:59.044
The red ticket wins...
The Balloon Ride!

17
00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.477
Horray!

18
00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.649
All aboard forthe balloon ride!

19
00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.844
How many passengers, please?

20
00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:06.919
Four please.

21
00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.112
And Teddy!

22
00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.212
Dine-saw!

23
00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.916
Oh, and a teddy and a dinosaur
that makes six.

24
00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.593
All aboard!

25
00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.058
Hurry up, Daddy Pig!
Hop aboard!

26
00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.258
Quick, Daddy!

27
00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.131
Splice the main brace!

28
00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.103
Chocks away! Full steam ahead!

29
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.701
Very impressive, Miss Rabbit.

30
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.902
You must be an expert pilot.

31
00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.674
Not really, this the first time
I've everflown a balloon.

32
00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:34.474
Oh...

33
00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:35.776
Hold Tight!

34
00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.113
Miss Rabbit heats up
the air in the balloon

35
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.152
to make it rise into the sky.

36
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.379
Bye bye.

37
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.319
Bye bye.

38
00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.616
Would anyone like to
do the map reading?

39
00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:47.489
I will.

40
00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.221
Are you sure, Daddy Pig?

41
00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.890
I'm very good at map reading.

42
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.801
Oh... this map is a bit difficult.

43
00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:58.800
Shall we go higher?

44
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.307
Yes, please! Higher! Higher!

45
00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.142
The balloon is rising high
into the sky.

46
00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.548
Oh! Where did the sky go!

47
00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.217
Don't worry, Peppa,

48
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.379
we're just flying
through a cloud.

49
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.085
Oooh.

50
00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:20.492
Wow, the sky is back again!

51
00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:21.686
Horray.

52
00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:29.432
Big balloon, big balloon,
biggerthan the sun and moon.

53
00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:35.942
Flying high, in the sky,
fly and fly and fly and fly...

54
00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.974
Look, Teddy,
we're flying really high.

55
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.173
Peppa,
be careful you don't drop...

56
00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.784
Teddy! I've dropped Teddy!

57
00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.481
Don't worry, Peppa.
We'll rescue Teddy.

58
00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:53.684
Hold tight, everybody!
We're going down!

59
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.019
Miss Rabbit is making
the balloon go down

60
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.961
so that Teddy can be rescued.

61
00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.031
I can't see Teddy anywhere.

62
00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:01.658
There he is!

63
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.700
Teddy's caught in a tree.

64
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.569
I can use this anchor
to rescue Teddy.

65
00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:12.444
Slowly, slowly. There!

66
00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.847
Daddy Pig has rescued Teddy.

67
00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:15.982
Teddy!

68
00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.073
Horray!

69
00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:19.416
Oh dear!

70
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.351
No one is looking
where they are going.

71
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.980
Look out! Tree straight ahead!

72
00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.320
Hold tight!

73
00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.622
Oh!
First Teddy was stuck in a tree

74
00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.666
and now we are stuck in a tree.

75
00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.994
Daddy Pig,
do you know where we are?

76
00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:37.361
Hmmm.

77
00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.628
We. Re lost, aren't we?

78
00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:40.703
Yes.

79
00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:41.841
Oooh.

80
00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:43.803
Look, everyone!

81
00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.446
Thats Granny
and Grandpa's house?

82
00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:49.982
Yes! We must be
in Grandpa Pig's garden!

83
00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.107
As I thought.

84
00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:52.648
Ahoy there,

85
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.982
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig!

86
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.614
Goodness me!

87
00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.988
Ahoy there, Miss Rabbit!

88
00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:02.994
Er... Help! Please.

89
00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:07.124
Grandpa, we can't get down!

90
00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.428
Don't worry. I've got a ladder.

91
00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:11.594
Horray!

92
00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.667
Everyone climbs down
from the big balloon.

93
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.572
Granny! Grandpa!

94
00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:20.870
Miss Rabbit took us for a ride
in her big balloon.

95
00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.574
How very exciting.

96
00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.814
I'm afraid
the most exciting thing

97
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.787
we can offer is a piece of
my homemade chocolate cake.

98
00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:30.413
Homemade chocolate cake!

99
00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.083
That is exciting!

100
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.963
That was the best
balloon ride ever!

101
00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:40.090
Hmmm. And that was the best
chocolate cake ever!
