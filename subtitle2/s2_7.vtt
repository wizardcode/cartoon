00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.183
Rock pools

2
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.683
Peppa and George are going to the seaside
with Granny and Grandpa Pig.

3
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.400
Peppa and George love the seaside.

4
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.200
Oh, where has the sand gone?

5
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.800
There isn't any sand down this beach, Peppa.

6
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.783
No sand?
But we wanted to make sand castles.

7
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.183
Peppa and George love making sand castles.

8
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
No, no, George. Don't be upset!

9
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.100
There are lots of exciting things
to do on this rocky beach.

10
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.700
Like what?

11
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.683
When the sea goes out, it leaves little pools
of water in amongst the rocks.

12
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.100
That called rock pools.

13
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.083
And in these rock pools, there's something special
that the sea has left behind.

14
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.500
I can see something glittering.

15
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
It's a coin.

16
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.300
Maybe it's a pirate's treasure.

17
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.500
Let's make a collection of all the things we find.

18
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.483
Yes,
we'll put them in George's bucket.

19
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.400
What surprise is waiting in this pool?

20
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.800
There's nothing special in this one.

21
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.700
There's always something, Peppa.

22
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.800
Look closer!

23
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.600
Whoa, there is something.

24
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.000
Yes, it's a crab!

25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.300
The crab is pinching Grandpa Pig's finger.

26
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.900
Ouch!

27
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.500
Naughty, Mr. Crab.

28
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.483
Look, George.
Mr. Crab is walking side ways.

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.900
George is pretending to be a crab.

30
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.000
Peppa wants to be a crab, too.

31
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.983
We're naughty crabs.
Pinch, pinch, pinch!

32
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.000
Pinch, pinch, pinch!

33
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.983
There are two naught crabs trying to pinch.

34
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.583
We're naughty crabs.
Pinch pinch, pinch!

35
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.500
Shoo, shoo, shoo,
you naughty crabs.

36
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.600
Go back to your little rock pools.

37
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.583
Yes, let's look in more rock pools.

38
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.200
What can you see?

39
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.500
A seashell.

40
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.600
Can you hearthe sea in it?

41
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.800
What do you mean?

42
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.783
If you put a shell to yourear,
you could hear the sea.

43
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.383
Wow, I can hearthe sea!

44
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.600
I love my seashell.

45
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.583
George, can you find a seashell, too?

46
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.400
Shell!

47
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.500
That's not a shell.

48
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Oh.

49
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300
Peppa's right.
That's not a shell.

50
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.200
George has found a fossil.

51
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.900
What's a fossil?

52
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.883
Afossil is the remains of an animal that lived
long ago when there were dinosaurs.

53
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.983
Dinosaur!

54
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.600
Rock pools are such fun!

55
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.100
Yes, they are fun for us.

56
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.200
But not forthis little fish.

57
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.100
A fish!
Where?

58
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.083
Poor little fish. She's trapped.

59
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.500
The little fish says she wants to
go back to the sea.

60
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.300
Maybe you could use your bucket
to rescue her.

61
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Yes.

62
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.000
Peppa is rescuing the little fish
in her bucket.

63
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.700
Don't worry, Mrs. Fish.

64
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.683
You'll soon be back with yourfriends.

65
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.100
Bye bye, Mrs. Fish.

66
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.083
Bye bye.

67
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.783
I love rock pools!
