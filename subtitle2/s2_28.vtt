2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Peppa and herfamily
are at the swimming poll.

3
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.300
Daddy pig is wearing
his swimming costume.

4
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.700
Mummy pig is wearing
herswimming costume.

5
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.100
Peppa is wearing
herswimming costume.

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.800
Hurry up, George!

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
Everyone is waiting.

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
George is wearing
his swimming costume.

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.200
Peppa, George,

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.183
let daddy put on yourarmbands.

11
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.800
There, George,

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Your armbands make you
look very grown-up.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.983
Now, me!

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.100
Good!

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.800
Now we can go in the water.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.783
Hooray!

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.100
It is George's first time
at a swimming pool.

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.083
Why don't you put just
one foot into the water?

19
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.400
Maybe you should
try the otherfoot.

20
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.400
Maybe George should try both
feet at the same time.

21
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.383
Good idea.

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Well done, George!

23
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.383
But you don't need to
splash quite so much.

24
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.700
Here is Rebecca Rabbit
with her little brother,

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.000
Richard Rabbit.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Hello, Rebecca!

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.800
Hello, everyone!

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.783
Richard, hold onto this float
and you can practice kicking your legs.

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.983
George, would you like to
try kicking your legs?

30
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.200
Very good,

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
but try not to splash.

32
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.800
Big children don't splash.

33
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.700
We are very good at swimming.

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.800
When George and Richard are older,

35
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.300
they'll be able to swim like us,

36
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.800
won't they, Rebecca?

37
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.900
Yes

38
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.800
Oh!

39
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400
Richard has a toy watering can.

40
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.700
Stop it, Richard!

41
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.600
Oh, dear,

42
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.583
Richard has dropped his watering
can into the pool.

43
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.600
Mummy!

44
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.100
Sorry, Richard,

45
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.500
I can't reach.

46
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500
It's too fardown.

47
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.700
Mummy!

48
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.800
I can't swim underwater.

49
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.500
Even I can't swim underwater.

50
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.400
Mmm, please hold my glasses, mummy pig.

51
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.383
Er

52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.800
Hooray!

53
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.000
There you go!

54
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.200
Well done, daddy pig!

55
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.183
I am rathergood at
swimming underwater.

56
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
The watering can is for babies.

57
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.700
Can we jump off the diving
boards above now?

58
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.800
Sorry, Peppa,

59
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.200
diving boards are only
forthe grown-ups.

60
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.700
Cheer up, you two.

61
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.800
You can watch me dive.

62
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.900
Silly daddy,

63
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.000
your tummy is too big.

64
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.300
Nonsense!

65
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.000
I won trophies for my diving
when I was younger.

66
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.100
That's quite a long time ago, daddy pig.

67
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.500
It's lucky I've kept myself
so fit and strong.

68
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.400
Please hold my glasses, mummy pig.

69
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
You'll get a better view
if you watch me from the side.

70
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.600
Please don't splash us
with water, daddy.

71
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.400
Of course I won't splash you, Peppa.

72
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.700
I think I need a higher board.

73
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700
Please be careful, daddy pig.

74
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.400
Yes, don't splash us, daddy.

75
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.383
Don't worry, Peppa.

76
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.200
Don't splash us with water, daddy.

77
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.600
I told you I wouldn't splash.

78
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.100
Clever daddy.

79
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.200
Well done, Daddy Pig.

80
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.100
No need for my towel,

81
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.000
I've got a special way
of drying myself.

82
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.800
Daddy pig has splashed
everyone with water.

83
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.400
Daddy pig.

84
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.383
Sorry, everyone.
