Polly's Holiday

2
00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:22.736
Granny and Grandpa Pig are
going on holiday.

3
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.639
They are bringing Polly Parrot
to Peppa's house

4
00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:27.804
so Peppa and George
can look after her.

5
00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:28.570
Waaa!

6
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.509
Hello, everyone!

7
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:36.320
Hello, Grandpa Pig!

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.615
Hello, Granny Pig!

9
00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:40.758
Polly is very excited about
her holiday

10
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:42.327
with Peppa and George.

11
00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:43.819
Hello, Polly.

12
00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:46.292
Waa! Hello, Polly.

13
00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:49.565
Polly Parrot copies everything
that is said.

14
00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:54.396
What's in Polly's suitcase,
Granny?

15
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:56.700
This is Polly's food.

16
00:00:56.954 --> 00:01:00.401
George, can you guess
what Polly likes to eat best?

17
00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:02.071
Chocolate Cake!

18
00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:05.173
Ha! No, not chocolate cake.

19
00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:07.314
Polly likes birdseed.

20
00:01:07.498 --> 00:01:09.181
Waa! Birdseed!

21
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:12.089
Can I feed her, Granny Pig!

22
00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:13.249
Can I feed her?

23
00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:14.520
Yes!

24
00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:18.424
It's very important
not to give Polly too much food.

25
00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:20.064
Yes, Grandpa Pig.

26
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:23.196
Grandpa,
can Polly come out of the cage?

27
00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:27.204
Yes, but you must keep all
the doors and windows closed,

28
00:01:27.318 --> 00:01:29.297
so Polly doesn't fly away.

29
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.101
Yes, Grandpa Pig.

30
00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:33.705
Goodbye, Peppa. Goodbye, George.

31
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.115
Goodbye, Granny Pig!
Goodbye, Grandpa Pig!

32
00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:41.085
Waa! Goodbye, Granny Pig!
Goodbye, Grandpa Pig!

33
00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:44.880
Would you like a cup of tea?

34
00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:48.022
Waa!
Would you like a cup of tea?

35
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.626
George has got Polly's birdseed.

36
00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:54.192
George!

37
00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:56.324
That is too much birdseed!

38
00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:00.565
Polly will grow very big and
burst like a balloon... POP!

39
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:03.606
Waa!
Burst like a balloon. Pop!!

40
00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:10.840
What's that noise?

41
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:12.007
ICE-CREAM!!

42
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.645
Ice-cream! Horray!

43
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:22.922
Oh dear, George has forgotten
to close the door.

44
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.667
Ice cream. Ice cream!

45
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.501
It is Miss Rabbit,
the ice cream lady.

46
00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:33.537
Hello, Mummy Pig.

47
00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:35.167
Hello, Miss Rabbit.

48
00:02:35.452 --> 00:02:36.805
Four ice creams, please.

49
00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:40.676
Thank you, Miss Rabbit!

50
00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:46.949
George!
You forgot to close the door!

51
00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:49.254
Polly will have flown away!

52
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:53.021
Don't worry, Peppa,
I'm sure Polly is still inside.

53
00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:56.818
Polly's not here!

54
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:57.862
Oh!

55
00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:00.523
Whaaaaaaaaaaa!

56
00:03:00.644 --> 00:03:01.963
We've lost Polly.

57
00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.501
Grandpa and Granny
are going to be very sad.

58
00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:08.501
Maybe we should try the garden.

59
00:03:09.286 --> 00:03:11.038
Look! What's that?

60
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:13.269
What has Mummy Pig seen
in the garden?

61
00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:14.509
Waaa!

62
00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.509
It's Polly! Horray!!

63
00:03:18.862 --> 00:03:22.787
But Daddy, how are we going
to get Polly down from the tree?

64
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.816
Don't worry, Peppa,
I'll rescue Polly.

65
00:03:28.472 --> 00:03:29.621
Come on, Polly.

66
00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:30.353
Waaa!

67
00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:32.153
Would you like a cup of tea?

68
00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:36.292
Oh no, Polly has
flown higher up the tree!

69
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.401
OH! DEAR.

70
00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:39.594
Be careful, Daddy!

71
00:03:39.717 --> 00:03:43.232
Don't fall out the tree
like you always do.

72
00:03:43.387 --> 00:03:46.072
Don't worry, Peppa,
I'll be very careful.

73
00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:48.379
Come on, Polly.

74
00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.615
Waa! Birseed!!!

75
00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:53.942
I wonderwhere George is going?

76
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.222
George has got Polly's birdseed.

77
00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.321
Polly loves to eat birdseed.

78
00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:01.556
Waa!!!!

79
00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:06.662
George has got Polly down
from the tree!

80
00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:07.764
Horray!

81
00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:11.029
What's that noise?

82
00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:13.064
Daddy Pig's mobile phone
is ringing!

83
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.566
What? Whoa...!

84
00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:20.468
Hello. Oh, Granny Pig!

85
00:04:20.758 --> 00:04:24.910
Hello, Daddy Pig.
Please may I talk to Polly?

86
00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:27.349
Yes, of course!

87
00:04:28.298 --> 00:04:31.187
Hello, Polly.
Are you having a nice holiday?

88
00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:35.959
Waa! Hello, Polly.
Are you having a nice holiday?!
