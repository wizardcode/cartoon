00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:19.268
Tiny creatures

2
00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:23.403
Peppa and George are helping
Grandpa Pig pick vegetables.

3
00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:26.645
Peppa, here is a lettuce.

4
00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:28.280
Thank you, Grandpa.

5
00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:31.650
Oh, what's that? Whaa!

6
00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:34.185
There's a
horrible monster on it!

7
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.052
Mon-sta!

8
00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:44.159
That's not a monster.
It's just a Little snail.

9
00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:47.856
Oh! Where has he gone?

10
00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:50.458
He's hiding in his shell.

11
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:52.333
Is that where he lives?

12
00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.532
Yes, it's his house.

13
00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:58.235
Look,
he's coming out again.

14
00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.375
Hello, Mr. Snail.

15
00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:05.279
Grandpa, does Mr. Snail
have a bed in his house?

16
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.350
No, Peppa.

17
00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:12.652
If I were a snail,
I'd have a bed and a table

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.922
and a chair
and a fridge and a television...

19
00:01:19.243 --> 00:01:22.064
Grandpa, what do snails eat?

20
00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:25.899
Well!
Mostly they eat my vegetables!

21
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:31.101
Hey,
stop that you cheeky rascal!

22
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.011
Grandpa! George and I want to
play cheeky snails.

23
00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:41.012
These baskets
can be yourshells.

24
00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:45.382
There, now you look like
two cheeky snails.

25
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.224
And I am going to eat up
all Grandpa Pig's lettuce.

26
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.128
Oy!
Keep off my lovely lettuce,

27
00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:55.462
you cheeky snails.

28
00:01:55.613 --> 00:01:58.161
And when
Grandpa Pig shouts at me

29
00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:00.261
I'll hide in my Little house.

30
00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:08.879
All of Peppa's friends are here.

31
00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:12.975
Hello, Grandpa Pig.

32
00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:14.348
Hello, Suzy,

33
00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.719
have you come to play
with Peppa and George?

34
00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:18.688
Yes.

35
00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:21.360
I don't know where they are.

36
00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.125
It's just me and
these two snails here.

37
00:02:26.243 --> 00:02:30.395
We are cheeky snails.

38
00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:32.937
Surprise!

39
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:40.240
We were pretending to be snails!

40
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:43.011
Can we be snails, too?

41
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.584
I don't think I have
enough baskets for you all.

42
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.845
Oooh.

43
00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:49.784
You could be
something else though.

44
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.687
Something exciting
from the garden.

45
00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:53.758
A Carrot?

46
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:55.754
Rebecca Rabbit likes carrots.

47
00:02:55.873 --> 00:03:00.822
No, Rebecca, not carrots.
Come over here.

48
00:03:03.714 --> 00:03:05.602
What's that buzzing sound?

49
00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:08.465
It's coming
from that Little house.

50
00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.832
Grandpa,
why is that doll's house

51
00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:13.503
making a funny buzzing noise?

52
00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:16.172
That's not a doll's house,
Peppa.

53
00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:20.650
It's a bee's house.
It's called a hive.

54
00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:21.844
Ooooh.

55
00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:24.150
Look, here's one now.

56
00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:28.453
What's she doing?

57
00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:31.760
She's collecting
nectar from the flower

58
00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:36.596
and then she flies back to
the hive to make it into honey.

59
00:03:36.814 --> 00:03:38.532
Hmmm, I like honey.

60
00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.697
Let's pretend to be bees.

61
00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:43.036
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

62
00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:48.238
Yes, let's be bees.
Buzz, buzz, buzz...

63
00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:53.549
My! What busy bees!

64
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:58.013
Yes, we're busy bees. Buzz!

65
00:03:58.168 --> 00:04:01.592
Now, we must fly back to
our hive to make honey.

66
00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.354
Buzz, buzz...

67
00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:07.728
Goodness me!
What do we have here?

68
00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:11.167
Granny! We're busy bees. Buzzz.

69
00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:14.205
Ah! Would you busy
bees like some toast?

70
00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:15.501
Yes, please!

71
00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.837
And what would you
like on your toast?

72
00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:19.070
Honey!

73
00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:20.234
That's lucky,

74
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:23.508
because that's what I've made:
Toast and honey!

75
00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:25.049
Horray!

76
00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:29.778
I like being a bee because
they eat lots of lovely honey.

77
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.826
I like being a snail because
they eat all Grandpa's lettuce.

78
00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:39.028
Oy! You cheeky rascal!
