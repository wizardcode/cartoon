00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:18.584
Nature Trail!

2
00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:22.922
Today, Peppa and herfamily are
driving out to the countryside.

3
00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:25.859
Daddy, what will we see
in the countryside?

4
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.790
We'll see birds and trees
and flowers and bees...

5
00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:31.730
Dine-saw!

6
00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:33.030
No, George,

7
00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:36.197
I don't think we'll see
any dinosaurs.

8
00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:40.609
This is the start of
the nature trail.

9
00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:41.505
We're here!

10
00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:42.373
Horray!

11
00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:46.006
Daddy Pig,
don't forget the picnic.

12
00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.741
As if I would.

13
00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:51.716
Daddy,
how do we know which way to go?

14
00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:52.749
Easy.

15
00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:55.721
The map says
there should be a sign

16
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:58.157
showing the start of
the nature trail...

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.886
here!

18
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:00.224
Well done, Daddy Pig.

19
00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:03.298
Oh dear,

20
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:05.732
Daddy Pig has
forgotten the picnic.

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.405
Peppa, what interesting things
can you see?

22
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.810
Just trees and trees
and more boring trees.

23
00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:19.813
Peppa,
you're not looking hard enough.

24
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:20.916
Alright!

25
00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:25.249
I'll look really hard and
I still won't see anything...

26
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.486
Oh, what's that?

27
00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:29.454
Peppa has found some footprints.

28
00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:31.623
Whose footprints are these?

29
00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:32.694
Dine-Saw!

30
00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:37.165
Oh, George,
they're not dinosaur footprints.

31
00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:40.134
Let's follow the footprints
and see who made them.

32
00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:41.033
Yes!

33
00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:42.370
Shhh!

34
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:46.405
We have to be very quiet,
so we don't scare anything away.

35
00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:47.643
Yes, Mummy.

36
00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:49.977
George, Shhh!

37
00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:51.542
Shhh!

38
00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:54.749
Peppa and George are following
the footprints.

39
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.917
Look!

40
00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:58.755
The footprints were made by
a Little bird.

41
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.780
She's flown into a tree.

42
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.652
Where?

43
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.359
Here, Peppa,
look through the binoculars.

44
00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:07.429
The binoculars make everything
look bigger.

45
00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.692
I can see one! Two!

46
00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:11.732
Three baby birds.

47
00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:12.932
Ahhh...

48
00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:14.766
I wonder what they're eating...

49
00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:16.666
Urggghhhh!

50
00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:19.401
They're eating worms!

51
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:21.876
That. S disgusting!

52
00:02:24.693 --> 00:02:26.672
George has found
more footprints.

53
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.946
Ooof! What Little footprints!

54
00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:33.284
The footprint are
being made by ants!

55
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:35.687
They're collecting
leaves to eat.

56
00:02:35.804 --> 00:02:38.261
Are they going to
have salad for lunch?

57
00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:39.385
Yes.

58
00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:42.055
Talking of lunch,
let's have our picnic.

59
00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:43.599
Oh, the picnic...

60
00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:44.667
Daddy Pig!

61
00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:47.065
You've left the picnic
in the car, haven't you?

62
00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:50.606
Er, yes...
but it's not a problem,

63
00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.971
we'll just go back
to the car to eat.

64
00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:54.771
But which way
is the car?

65
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.846
My map will show us.

66
00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.038
This way!

67
00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.444
Ooof!

68
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.040
Who put that tree there?

69
00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:02.208
It's not on the map.

70
00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:03.810
Oh, Daddy Pig!

71
00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:05.445
We. Re lost, aren't we?

72
00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:07.580
Er... yes.

73
00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:10.721
How are we going to
find our Little car?

74
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.362
George has found
more footprints.

75
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.057
Oooh, what big footprints?

76
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:18.463
Dine-saw!

77
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.165
Very interesting.

78
00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:21.101
What?

79
00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:25.071
Has George found
some real dinosaurfootprints?

80
00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:28.701
No, these are our footprints.

81
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.938
And if we follow our footprints,

82
00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.209
we'll find the way
back to ourcar.

83
00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:34.841
And our picnic!

84
00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:36.009
Horray!

85
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.248
Nothing can stop us
finding our car now.

86
00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:43.050
We're home and dry.

87
00:03:43.605 --> 00:03:46.426
Oh, I wasn't expecting that.

88
00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:48.361
Luckily,

89
00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.228
I remembered the umbrella.

90
00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:53.498
The rain is washing
the footsteps away.

91
00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:56.067
How are going to
find the car now?

92
00:03:56.217 --> 00:03:57.798
And our picnic...

93
00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:00.472
It's the ducks!

94
00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:03.546
They always turn up at picnics.

95
00:04:03.658 --> 00:04:04.773
Sorry, Mrs. Duck,

96
00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.941
we haven't got
a picnic this time.

97
00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:08.415
We can't find it.

98
00:04:09.397 --> 00:04:10.250
I know!

99
00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:14.313
Mrs. Duck, can you help us find
our picnic, please?

100
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:20.053
We're here!

101
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:21.162
Horray!

102
00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:22.728
Thank you, Mrs. Duck.

103
00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:30.168
I love nature trails!

104
00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:33.265
Yes, and I love picnics!

105
00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:35.504
And the ducks love picnics!

106
00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:37.409
And the Little birds
love picnics!

107
00:04:37.592 --> 00:04:39.674
And the ants love picnics!

108
00:04:39.794 --> 00:04:41.978
Everybody loves picnics.
