00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:28.445
Peppa and George are drinking orange juice.

2
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.913
What a noise! Little piggies!

3
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.034
George, look at all the tiny bubbles.

4
00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:42.529
I can make bigger bubbles.

5
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.279
Peppa is blowing bubbles in her drink.

6
00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:51.052
George wants to blow bubbles too.

7
00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.313
Peppa, George, you really
shouldn't play with your food!

8
00:00:58.963 --> 00:00:59.907
Sorry, Daddy.

9
00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:05.270
Peppa, if you like bubbles,
Why don't you play with your bubble mixture?

10
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.804
Yes! My bubble mixture!

11
00:01:08.378 --> 00:01:11.290
George, let's blow bubbles in the garden.

12
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.470
Peppa is showing George how to blow bubbles.

13
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:21.014
First, dip the stick in the mixture.

14
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.164
Then, take a big breath and blow.

15
00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:31.237
Heeee... bubble!

16
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.584
George, now it's your turn!

17
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.850
Dip the stick in the mixture,

18
00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:41.767
hold it up,

19
00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:43.552
take big breath,

20
00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:45.688
and blow!

21
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.197
George is trying really hard,
but he. S running out of breath!

22
00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.829
George, you didn't blow hard enough!

23
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.024
I know a way George can make bubbles.

24
00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:10.458
Dip the stick in the mixture,
then lift it up and wave it around.

25
00:02:12.753 --> 00:02:13.333
Bubble!

26
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:18.722
It's even better if you run along.

27
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:24.227
Wait for me!

28
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.738
George is having fun making bubbles,

29
00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:32.101
and Peppa is having fun popping.

30
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.473
I love bubbles!

31
00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:40.688
Oh, dear! The bubble mixture is all used up.

32
00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:44.276
Daddy, Mummy!

33
00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.198
There's no more bubble mixture!

34
00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:50.145
Don't worry, Peppa. I have an idea.

35
00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:53.816
Mummy Pig, bring me a bucket, please!

36
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.343
Yes! Daddy Pig.

37
00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:57.869
Peppa, bring me some soap!

38
00:02:57.883 --> 00:02:59.282
Yes, Daddy Pig.

39
00:02:59.851 --> 00:03:02.854
George, bring me my old tennis racket.

40
00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:10.417
A bucket, some soap, a tennis racket!
What is Daddy Pig doing?

41
00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:12.764
First, I need some water.

42
00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:18.741
Then, the soap.

43
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:23.181
And now, the tennis racket, please!

44
00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:24.822
Thank you!

45
00:03:25.412 --> 00:03:26.731
Now watch this!

46
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.997
Woo... Wow!

47
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.525
Daddy Pig has made his own bubble mixture.

48
00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:40.730
Come on, everyone!

49
00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:44.959
Be careful! Daddy Pig! Don't slip and fall.

50
00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:46.874
I'll be fine! Wow...

51
00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:57.444
Are you Ok, Daddy Pig?

52
00:03:57.807 --> 00:04:01.083
Yes, I'm fine!

53
00:04:01.928 --> 00:04:02.417
Wow!

54
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.384
Daddy Pig has made the biggest bubble ever!

55
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.919
Oh dear! I've spilled all my bubble mixture.

56
00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:14.991
Now, we can't make any more bubbles!

57
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.080
But we can play jumping in muddy puddles! Look!

58
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.093
Daddy Pig's bubble mixture
has made a big muddy puddle!

59
00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:25.246
Hurray!

60
00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:30.605
Peppa loves jumping up and down
in muddy puddles!

61
00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:35.423
Look! The bubble mixture has made
the puddle all bubbly!

62
00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:39.816
Peppa loves jumping up and down
in muddy bubbly puddles!

63
00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:43.512
Everyone loves jumping up and down
in muddy bubbly puddles!
