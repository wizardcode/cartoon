The Cycle ride

2
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.400
It is a lovely sunny day.

3
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.100
Peppa and George are
finishing their breakfast.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400
Today is a good day
for a cycle ride.

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.500
A cycle ride, yippee!

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.900
Peppa and George love cycle ride

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.900
Peppa has her bicycle.

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
George has his tricycle,

9
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.100
mummy and daddy
have their tandem.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.600
What's that?

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.900
It's our bicycle.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.800
I sit at the front and
mummy pig sit at the back.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
And we can put these two seats
on the back for peppa and George.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
But we want to
ride ourown bicycles.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.200
George is a bit too little
his legs will be very tired.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.800
But I am a big girl,

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.300
I won. T get tired.

18
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.800
It will be a long cycle ride,

19
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.900
Peppa, are you sure?

20
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.100
Yes, daddy, I am sure.

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
Ok, are we all ready?

22
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.600
Yes, daddy pig.

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.900
Then Let's go.

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.300
Wee...

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.700
I am winning.

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400
It is not a race, Peppa.

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.800
It's just a gentle bicycle ride.

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.783
Yes, daddy but I. M still winning.

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.183
Haha, now we are winning.

30
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.100
I don't like cycling up hill.

31
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
Peppa, we won the race.

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.000
No, you didn't, daddy.

33
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.100
Because I wasn't racing that time.

34
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.400
But now I am

35
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400
Can't catch me.

36
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.600
Ah, you cheeky little piggy.

37
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.583
Hello, ducks, we are
having a cycle ride.

38
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.783
Hello, ducks.

39
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.600
I've forgotten how much
I love cycling.

40
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.583
Oh, I've forgotten how much
I hate cycling up hills.

41
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.000
The ground is getting quite steep.

42
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.200
I don. T like cycling up hills.

43
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.600
But look at the beautiful view.

44
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.583
My goodness, this is hard work.

45
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.600
Mummy pig, you're not peddling.

46
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.200
Sorry, daddy pig,

47
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.000
I was just enjoying the view.

48
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.400
Peppa and herfamily have
reached the top of the hill

49
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.900
All peppa's friends are here.

50
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.000
Hello, peppa.

51
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.200
Hello.

52
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.300
We are going to have a race on our bikes.

53
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.100
Peppa, do you want to race too?

54
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.900
Ok, as long as we race down the hill.

55
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.400
Ok.

56
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.700
Peppa and herfriends are
going to race down the hill.

57
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.800
Are you all ready?

58
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.000
Ready.

59
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.800
You can start when I honk the horn.

60
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.200
Like this.

61
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.700
Pedro has set off too soon.

62
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.200
Stop, Pedro.

63
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.100
The race hasn't started yet.

64
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.900
Sorry, MR. Pig.

65
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.883
I was just letting you know
that the horn sounds like this.

66
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.600
Stop! Stop!

67
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.000
Sorry, Pedro.

68
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.800
That time was my fault.

69
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.100
The next time
when I honk the horn,

70
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.500
you can go.

71
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.300
Did you say go?

72
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.200
I think so.

73
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.900
Go! Go! Go!

74
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.100
Go on, Peppa.

75
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.083
But daddy, you
didn't honk the horn.

76
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
Danny dog is in the lead.

77
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.700
Wait for me.

78
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.100
Wee... I win!

79
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.700
Well done, Peppa.

80
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.683
Yes, I'm very good at
cycling down hill.

81
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.900
It is home time
for Peppa's friends.

82
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.500
Byebye, Peppa.

83
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.900
Bye.

84
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.100
Home time for us too, Peppa.

85
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.400
Mummy, I am tired.

86
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.383
All the cycling up and down
the hills has made my legs tired.

87
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.600
Can I ride on your bike?

88
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.100
But where would daddy pig sit?

89
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.200
Well, Daddy can ride my bike.

90
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.800
It's very nice.

91
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.783
Oh, okay.

92
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.200
I love the tandem.

93
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.900
Daddy, do you like my bike?

94
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.883
Yes, Peppa, it's very nice.
