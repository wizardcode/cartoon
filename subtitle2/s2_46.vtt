00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.700
Madam gazelle, I don't feel very well.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.900
The bus is very bumpy.

5
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.500
Oh, dear.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.983
Poor pedro, come and sit
in the front with me.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.700
There, is that better?

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.100
A little bit.

10
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.500
Madam gazelle.

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, do you feel sick too, Zoe?

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.300
I might feel sick later,

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
can I sit at front just in case?

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600
Can I sit at the front too?

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.100
And me, me...

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.700
Oh, I'm sorry children;

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.000
you can't all sit at the front.

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.200
Oh!

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.500
Never mind,

20
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.100
we are at the camp side now.

21
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.100
Hooray!

22
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.300
Happy camping, everyone.

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.400
Bye-bye!

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.700
Ohoh, this is our camp side.

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.683
Breathe in the wonderful fresh air, children.

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.600
Excellent breathing!

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.700
Now let's put up ourtents.

28
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.683
Peppa and herfriends are
putting up theirtents.

29
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.883
Children, you must each find a partner
to share yourtent.

30
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
Suzy, shall we share a tent?

31
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.300
I said I'd share with Zoe.

32
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.800
Oh, sorry Suzy,

33
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.100
I said I'd share with Rebecca.

34
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000
Rebecca, you said you'd share with me.

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800
Oh, yes.

36
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.300
Emily, who you are going to share tent with?

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.400
Zoe!

38
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.500
Ok!

39
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.100
Good, now you can share with me.

40
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.200
OK!

41
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.200
Now I need sticks to make a campfire.

42
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.800
We'll get sticks.

43
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.400
But me and Pedro want to get sticks.

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.400
Haha, you can all collect sticks.

45
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.383
Peppa and herfriends collect sticks
for the camp fire.

46
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.200
Wonderful!

47
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.500
It is night-time.

48
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.300
Peppa and herfriends are
sitting around the camp fire.

49
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.200
Children, let us all sing a song.

50
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200
Yes! The bing bong song, please.

51
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900
Oh, I am not sure.

52
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.700

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.700

Me too.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Attention, children.

68
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.983
No more giggling please.

69
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
What was that funny noise?

70
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.000
I don't know.

71
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.500
There it is again.

72
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.700
Suzy, where are you going?

73
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.000
Madam gazelle,

74
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.300
I am a bit scared.

75
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.600
Would you like to come in?

76
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.200
Yes, please.

77
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.300

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.700
Of course.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.500
I think I might be scared later.

82
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500
I might be scared later too.
