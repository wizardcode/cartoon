Peppa and herfriends are
going to playgroup today.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:30.393
The children each have their
own hook to hang their coats on.

4
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:35.600
Today, we have a new pupil,

5
00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:37.834
Emily Elephant.

6
00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:39.099
Hello, Emily!

7
00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:40.237
Hello.

8
00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.201
Emily is a bit shy.

9
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:45.845
Who would like to show Emily
where to hang her coat?

10
00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:47.507
Me! Me! Me! Me!

11
00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:49.977
We just need one.

12
00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.185
Peppa, can you show Emily
where to hang hercoat?

13
00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:55.848
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

14
00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:59.195
We each have our own coat hooks.

15
00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:01.455
This one is foryou, Emily.

16
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:05.235
Emily is hanging her coat
on her very own coat hook.

17
00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:08.831
Now, Emily,
what would you like to do today?

18
00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:12.435
Painting,
clay or building-blocks?

19
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:14.677
Um. I don't know.

20
00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:18.078
Maybe building-blocks.

21
00:01:18.327 --> 00:01:22.252
And everyone else; painting,
clay or building-blocks?

22
00:01:22.364 --> 00:01:23.820

Building-blocks
are populartoday!

25
00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:32.289
Everyone wants to sit
next to Emily Elephant.

26
00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:36.255
Emily, you put one block
on top of another.

27
00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:37.829
Like this.

28
00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:41.632
It's better
if you put them side-by-side.

29
00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:44.472
No, this way, Emily.

30
00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.139
This is the right way, Emily.

31
00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.546
No, Emily! Like this.

32
00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.076
You're all being very helpful.

33
00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.847
But Emily, how would you
play with the blocks?

34
00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:59.047
Um. I'm not very sure.

35
00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:01.256
I might do it like this.

36
00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:05.061
Wow!

37
00:02:05.707 --> 00:02:07.857
Emily Elephant is good
at building-blocks.

38
00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:10.493
It is playtime.

39
00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:11.824
Horray!

40
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.969
Emily, would you like to play
outside with the others?

41
00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:19.436
Yes, please.

42
00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:22.009
Can someone show Emily
where we play?

43
00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.138
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

44
00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.843
At playtime,
