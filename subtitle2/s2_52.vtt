That's better.

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.800
I was watching that.

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.600
But it was a bit boring, daddy.

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.591

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Don't stay up too late.

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Good night, Mummy.

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.583
But the sleepover
is only for big girls.

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000
They are so sweet and little.
Can they stay?

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.500
Ok, but you must promise
you'll stay awake.

30
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.300
We promise.

31
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
Wow, a piano.

32
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.100
I am having lessons,
listen...

33
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.900
Twinkle twinkle little star,
can I have a go?

34
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.891
And me.
Twinkle twinkle little star,

35
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.891
how I wonder what you are...

36
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.183
Shush, you must be quiet,

37
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200
so Daddy Zebra can sleep.

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.183
Now into yoursleeping bags please.

39
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.100
What do we do now?

40
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.083
On sleepovers,
there. S always a midnight feast.

41
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.600
What's a midnight feast?

42
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.000
We eat things in secret.

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.983
Woo, I know where's the food,
but we must be very quiet.

44
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.483
Shhh, Suzy, Shhh,
Peppa. Quiet...

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
Mummy Zebra has woken up.

46
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.683
We are going to have
the best midnight feast ever.

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.600
What's going on?
You'll wake Daddy Zebra.

48
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.600
Now who knows a nice
gentle bedtime story.

49
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.300
Me, and me...

50
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.291
I'll start. Once upon a time,

51
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.291
there was a little fairy,
now yourturn Peppa,

52
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.800
And she lived in the forest.

53
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.900
She was very pretty.

54
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.300
And she had a fairy wand.

55
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.300
Lovely.

56
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.400
Your turn, Emily,
tell us what happens next.

57
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.900
Well, I am not very sure.

58
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.300
Just say anything, Emily.

59
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.800
As long as it isn't boring.

60
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.783
Ok, the little fairy met
a big monster, who went...?

61
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.300
Gee, Too scary.

62
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.800
What's all these noise?

63
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.600
Oh, dear, the noise
has woken up Mr. Zebra.

64
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.700
Sorry, daddy,
there was a story about a fairy.

65
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700
And a scary monster.

66
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.300
And we want to know
what happens next.

67
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.800
Very well.

68
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.783
The monster lifted up
his big hairy paws...

69
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.800
and walked along
on his big hairy feet.

70
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.100
Wow.

71
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.089
And he said

72
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.092
twinkle, twinkle little star,
how I wonder what you are.

73
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.483
Mr. Zebra's song has
sent everyone to sleep.
