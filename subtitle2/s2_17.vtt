00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.400
The long grass

2
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.300
Peppa and George
are playing in the garden.

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.200
Oh!

4
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400
The grass has not
been cut fora while.

5
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.900
It's grown very long.

6
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.300
Come on, George.

7
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.500
George, where are you?

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.900
I can't see you.

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.700
George, I am coming to get you.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.683
Peppa and George
can not see each other.

11
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.700
Haha.

12
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.683
Peppa and George love playing
in the long grass.

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Daddy pig is going to
read his newspaper.

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
What a nice day fordoing nothing.

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000
Daddy pig loves doing nothing.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700
Goodness me, daddy pig,

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
we've let the garden
get a bit out of our control.

18
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.800
What do you mean, mummy pig?

19
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.400
The grass, it needs cutting.

20
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400
Ho, I quite like it,

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.700
it the wild garden look.

22
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.200
Mummy, daddy,

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800
come and play in the long grass,

24
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.300
it's fun.

25
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.300
Okay,

26
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.283
let's all play with this spotty ball.

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, where's it gone?

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
The ball is lost in the long grass.

29
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.200
Now I'll never find it.

30
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.700
Maybe it's time to cut the grass.

31
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.500
Yes, daddy pig.

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.300
I. II get the lawn mower.

33
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.800
I am sure it's here somewhere.

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.100
Here it is.

35
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Daddy pig has found the lawn mower.

36
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.400
It's a bit old and rusty.

37
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.300
Nonsense.

38
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.283
It. II have grass cut in no time.

39
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.900
It does a bit rusty.

40
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.700
Maybe i should phone grandpa pig and
ask if he could borrow us his lawn mower.

41
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.200
This's no need to phone grandpa.

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.600
I just need to push it a bit harder.

43
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.583
Daddy pig's lawn mower is not very good.

44
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.100
Oh, I know,

45
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.400
let's phone grandpa.

46
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.800
Hello, grandpa pig speaking.

47
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.400
Hello, grandpa pig,

48
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300
could you help us cut
some very long grass?

49
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.700
Oh, certainly,

50
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.700
I'll be over right away.

51
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.200
Bye.

52
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.183
I think this is a job for Betsy.

53
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.283
Grandpa pig is driving his motor
mower over to peppa's house.

54
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.500
Grandpa pig! Papa lg!

55
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.300
Hello, everyone.

56
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.000
I hear there's some grass
that needs cutting.

57
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.300
And it's just a bit too long
for my lawn mower.

58
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.500
Don't worry,

59
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.000
Betsy will have it done in no time.

60
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.900
Is your lawn mower called Betsy?

61
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.800
She certainly is.

62
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.000
Hello, Betsy.

63
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.900
Grandpa, can we ride on Betsy?

64
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.300
Of course you can.

65
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.700
Hop aboard.

66
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.900
Aye-aye. Captain grandpa.

67
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.600
We'll have this grass cut in no time.

68
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.000
Hold tight, here we go.

69
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.300
Wee...

70
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.300
Betsy is very good at cutting grass.

71
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.283
This is fun.

72
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.900
There, finished.

73
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.200
Grandpa, you've missed a bit.

74
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.600
Oh, yes.

75
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.800
What's this?

76
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.900
Oh, The spotty ball.

77
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.000
Thank you forfinding our ball, grandpa.

78
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.100
And thank you for cutting the grass.

79
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.083
Cutting grass is easy for Betsy.

80
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.800
Now we can play with our spotty ball.

81
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.000
To you, daddy.

82
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.700
The ball bounce very well
on the short grass.

83
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.800
To you, George.

84
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.500
Baba lg.

85
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.483
Oh, oh, Catch!
