00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:18.267
Cuckoo Clock

2
00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:20.567
It is early morning.

3
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:23.672
Mummy and Daddy Pig
are still asleep.

4
00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:29.078
Wakey, wakey, Mummy and Daddy!

5
00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:31.244
What?

6
00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:32.874
It's time to get up!

7
00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:35.176
It's much too early!

8
00:00:35.332 --> 00:00:37.288
Don't you know
what time it is, Peppa?

9
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.655
No, daddy!
Ourclock doesn't work!

10
00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:41.554
Oh dear.

11
00:00:41.672 --> 00:00:43.390
Let's see if we can mend it.

12
00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:48.591
Ah. The old cuckoo clock!

13
00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:51.094
Why is it called a cuckoo clock?

14
00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:55.063
There's a Little wooden bird
inside called a cuckoo.

15
00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:57.174
I've never seen the cuckoo.

16
00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:00.734
That's because we stopped
winding it a long time ago!

17
00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:02.541
The cuckoo got a bit annoying.

18
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:03.409
Oh.

19
00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:05.778
Can we wind it up again?
Please?!

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.549
Alright.

21
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:11.622
Daddy Pig is winding up
the cuckoo clock.

22
00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:12.723
There.

23
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.322
Daddy Pig sets the clock
to the right time.

24
00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:17.694
It is nearly 9 o. Clock.

25
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:20.464
Daddy,
can we see the cuckoo now?

26
00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:23.198
You'll see the cuckoo soon!

27
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.462
What does she look like, Daddy?

28
00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:27.001
Now, let me think.

29
00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:30.035
She moves her head like this...

30
00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:34.803
And she flaps
her wings like this...

31
00:01:36.193 --> 00:01:40.175
And she says, Cuckoo!

32
00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:43.454
Cuckoo!

33
00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.826
What a noisy
Little cuckoo you are, George!

34
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.926
Cuckoo!

35
00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.931
Look!
It's going to do something.

36
00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:56.057
Cuckoo!

37
00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:58.396
Wow!

38
00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:04.468
Silly George!
You missed the Cuckoo!

39
00:02:06.423 --> 00:02:08.971
The cuckoo was really,
really brilliant.

40
00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:13.241
She went: Cuckoo!
And you missed it.

41
00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:15.376
Wah!

42
00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.648
Never mind, George!

43
00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:18.883
You can see Cuckoo next time.

44
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:19.980
Yes, but you'll have to wait.

45
00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:22.685
Cuckoo only comes
out once an hour.

46
00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.595
Waiting is boring!

47
00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:28.865
Come on, George,
let's play outside.

48
00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.197
George does not
want to play outside.

49
00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:33.167
He is waiting to see Cuckoo.

50
00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.937
It is nearly 10 o'clock.

51
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:40.145
George has been waiting for
Cuckoo for almost an hour.

52
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.474
George, come and play!

53
00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:45.910
Mr. Dinosaurwants you to play,
too!

54
00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:50.918
Dine-saw!

55
00:02:52.436 --> 00:02:53.983
Cuckoo!

56
00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:57.290
George has missed Cuckoo again!

57
00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:59.386
Wah!

58
00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.056
Never mind, George.

59
00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:02.861
Why don't you play
in the garden.

60
00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:05.864
I'll call you when
it's time to see Cuckoo.

61
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:08.971
To you, George!

62
00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:14.677
It is nearly 11 o'clock.

63
00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:18.844
Peppa! George!
Time to see Cuckoo!

64
00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:20.479
Quick, George!

65
00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.815
You can't miss Cuckoo again!

66
00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:27.358
George is running faster
than he has ever run before.

67
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:31.690
Cuckoo!

68
00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:36.298
George, did you see Cuckoo?

69
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.163
Cuckoo...

70
00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:39.966
Cuckoo~

71
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:42.369
Peppa and George
love playing cuckoos.

72
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.737
Cuckoo...

73
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:49.240
It is night time.

74
00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:53.048
Peppa and George
are very sleepy.

75
00:03:53.397 --> 00:03:54.284
Cuckoo!

76
00:03:57.034 --> 00:03:58.717
Peppa and George are asleep.

77
00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:02.518
Cuckoo!

78
00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:04.654
Is it morning already?

79
00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.755
Er, no. Time to sleep.

80
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:10.193
Cuckoo is not very well!

81
00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:13.765
She just needs to sleep,
like you and George.

82
00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:15.104
Good night!

83
00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:17.402
Good night, my Little piggies.

84
00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.607
George, I know how
to make Cuckoo better.

85
00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.309
We'll wind her up
like Daddy did!

86
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:29.979
Mummy and Daddy are fast asleep.

87
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:31.447
What?

88
00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:33.489
Mummy! Daddy!

89
00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:35.787
We've got something to show you!

90
00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.793
We've made Cuckoo better!

91
00:04:38.308 --> 00:04:40.026
Cuckoo!
