Bedtime

2
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000
It is almost bedtime.

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.600
Peppa and George are
just finishing their supper.

4
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
Daddy Pig!

5
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit tired.

6
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.600
It's been a long day.

7
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600
George and I aren. T sleepy at all.

8
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.900
Can we play in the garden?

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.900
But it's almost your bedtime!

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.000
Can we play out side
for just a tiny bit?

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Please, Mummy!

12
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.300
Please, Daddy!

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.100
All right.

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.100
But you must come in
when we call you for your bath.

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.700
I don't know where they
get their energy from.

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.600
Peppa and George are playing one last game
outside before bedtime.

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
Look, George!

18
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.700
Lots of muddy puddles!

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000
Peppa and George
are wearing their boots.

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.300
They are going to jump up
and down in muddy puddles.

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.000
Peppa loves jumping up and down
in muddy puddles.

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.983
George loves jumping up and down
in muddy puddles.

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.900
Look!

24
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.700
The biggest puddle in the world!

25
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.683
What a huge, big puddle!

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.800
Peppa! George! Bathtime.

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.100
Daddy! Mummy!

28
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.600
We found the biggest
muddy puddle in the world.

29
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.300
I can see that.

30
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Quick, into the bath.

31
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800
Oh, Can't we just play outside
a bit longer?

32
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.783
No, it's bathtime.

33
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.900
Are you and George feeling sleepy?

34
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.100
No, Daddy.

35
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.083
We are not even a tiny bit sleepy.

36
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.700
Peppa and George might not be sleepy,

37
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.100
but I am.

38
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.700
Me, too!

39
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.500
Before bedtime,

40
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.400
Peppa and George have their bath.

41
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400
Peppa likes splashing.

42
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000
George likes splashing.

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Peppa and George both like splashing.

44
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.900
That's enough splashing.

45
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.000
Let. S get you dry and into your pajamas.

46
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.983
Oh, can't we just stay
in the bath a little bit longer.

47
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.100
Bathtime is over!

48
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.900
Now, it's time to clean your teeth.

49
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.100
Before going to bed,

50
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.083
Peppa and George brush theirteeth.

51
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.900
OK, that's enough brushing.

52
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.100
Into your beds!

53
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.800
Oh, I think our teeth
need a bit more cleaning.

54
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.900
When you're in bed,

55
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.300
Daddy Pig will read you a story.

56
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.900
Hooray.

57
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.883
Peppa and George like stories.

58
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
When Peppa goes to bed,

59
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.100
she always has her Teddy
tucked up with her.

60
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.400
When George goes to bed,

61
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.100
he always has Mr. Dinosaur
tucked up whth him.

62
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.300
Are you feeling sleepy now?

63
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.600
No, Daddy.

64
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.200
We need lots and lots of stories.

65
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.700
Daddy Pig will read you one story.

66
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.300
Now, which book do you want?

67
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.500
Um, "The Red Monkey"book.

68
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.200
OK, I'll read you
"The Red Monkey"book.

69
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.000
Peppa and George like the
"The Red Monkey" book.

70
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.900
Onec upon a time...

71
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.700
Oh, sorry, Daddy Pig.

72
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.900
Once upon a time
there was a Red Monkey,

73
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.600
and this Red Monkey had a bath.

74
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.400
And cleaned his teeth.

75
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.200
He got into his bed.

76
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.000
And soon he fell fast asleep.

77
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.200
Good night, Red Monkey.

78
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200
Peppa and George are asleep.

79
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.200
Goodnight, Peppa and George!

80
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.183
Sleep well!

81
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400
Now, Peppa and George are asleep.

82
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.200
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig
are going to watch some television.

83
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.900
And now it's time for
"The amazing Mr. Potato."

84
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.600
I've been looking forward to
watching this program.

85
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.200
The Amazing Mr. Potato
is always ready for action.

86
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.800
He runs fast.

87
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.900
He jumps high.

88
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.883
He neversleeps.

89
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.500
It is bedtime for Peppa and George.

90
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.483
And it looks as if it is bedtime
for Mummy and Daddy too.
