00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.900
The Time Capsule

2
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.400
Peppa and her friends
are at their playgroup.

3
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Today, We are going to
make a time capsule.

4
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.300
What. S a time capsule?

5
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.283
A time capsule is something that will
show people in the future how we lived.

6
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
How?

7
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.200
We'll put special things in this box.

8
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.700
And then we'll bury it
in the school garden.

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.400
Will it grow?

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.300
No, Suzy.

11
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.400
It will remain in the ground for many years.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200
Oooh.

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400
Now,
what things should we put inside?

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.600
A Comic!

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800
Very good, Peppa.

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.000
Music!

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.600
Very good, Suzy...

18
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.200
Atoy!

19
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.800
A coin!

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.400
Stamps!

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.600
A carrot?

22
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.700
You do like carrots,
don't you, Rebecca?

23
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.300
Yes!

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.200
All those are excellent things
to show ourdaily lives.

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.900
Madame Gazelle,
what will the future be like?

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.100
What do you think it will be like?

27
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.083
I think in the future
I will live on the moon.

28
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.083
And all my friends will come to visit.

29
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
And I will fly a space rocket.

30
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.083
Hello!

31
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, we'll record a message
forthe people of the future.

32
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.800
Say"hello"to the future.

33
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.200
Hello to the future.

34
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.500
You're probably all living on the moon now.

35
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.900
...And going on holiday to Mars.

36
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.883
...And flying around in space rockets.

37
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.700
Wonderful!

38
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.400
It is nearly home time
and all the parents have arrived.

39
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.500
Mummy, Daddy.
We're made a time capsule.

40
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.300
Ah, Daddy Pig!

41
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.900
You're just in time to help us dig a hole.

42
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.883
Yes, of course.

43
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.183
Daddy Pig is digging a hole in the
school garden forthe time capsule.

44
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800
There!

45
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.100
Can we dig it up now?

46
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.700
It will remain in the ground for many years.

47
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.800
Oh, but I can't wait that long.

48
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.600
Peppa, you're just like your Daddy
when he was little.

49
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.800
Am I?

50
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.300
Yes, I remember
when I was his teacher.

51
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.000
Did you teach my Daddy?

52
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.300
Yes!

53
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.800
I taught all of your Mummies and Daddies.

54
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.500
Didn't I?

55
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

56
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.100
When your Mummies and Daddies were little.

57
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.600
They made a time capsule, too

58
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.700
Yes, we did.

59
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.800
We buried it next to a little tree.

60
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.300
Can we dig it up?

61
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.900
Yes, I think we buried it over here.

62
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.500
Oh!
I thought it was a much smallertree.

63
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.800
It was a long time ago!

64
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.783
The tree has grown a bit since then.

65
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.100
I've found something.

66
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.500
It's ourold time capsule.

67
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.000
Hooray!

68
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.500
I can't wait to open it.

69
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.900
Stand back, children.

70
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.200
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

71
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.700
What do we have here?

72
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.200
An old comic...

73
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.100
That was my favorite comic!

74
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.700
Atin toy.

75
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.000
My favorite toy!

76
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.300
Music.

77
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.300
My favorite record!

78
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.000
And... a very old carrot!

79
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.200
That's mine!

80
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.400
What a good choice! Mummy!

81
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.300
And a video tape of
your mummies and Daddies,

82
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.600
when they were little.

83
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600
Oooh.

84
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.100
Who's the little piggy in the glasses?

85
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.500
Ahhh. That's Daddy Pig.

86
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.900
Oh! And that's me.

87
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.200
Hello to the future!

88
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.000
What a squeaky voice you have!

89
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.200
You're probably living on the moon now.

90
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.300
Silly little Daddy Pig.

91
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.283
Making time capsules is such fun
and finding them is even better!
