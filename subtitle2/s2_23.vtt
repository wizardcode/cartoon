Where's Granny Pig?

10
00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:41.918
Hello, my Little ones.

11
00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.992
That is Granny Pig's voice,
but where is she?

12
00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.831
Granny Pig?

13
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:48.266
Here I am.

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:49.595

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:50.794
Gangy lg!

16
00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.568
Why is Granny in the roof?

17
00:00:53.718 --> 00:00:55.697
We're tidying the attic.

18
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.071
What's the attic?

19
00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:01.113
It's where we keep
all ourold things.

20
00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:02.977
Like you, Grandpa Pig?

21
00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.980
Things that are
even olderthan me.

22
00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:08.980
Can we help?

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.453
Ok!

24
00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:15.760
Granny and Grandpa's attic
is at the very top of the house.

25
00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:18.693
That's the door to the attic.

26
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.964
How do we get up there?

27
00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:22.932
I have a clevertrick.

28
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.468
Hello, my Little ones.

29
00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:28.630
It's Granny!

30
00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:29.706
Come on up!

31
00:01:31.222 --> 00:01:32.268
Oooh!

32
00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:36.876
This is our attic.

33
00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:39.449
Wow, it's very full!

34
00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:41.952
Yes, it's full of old junk.

35
00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:47.650
Peppa and George are here to
help us throw some things out.

36
00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:48.385
Good.

37
00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:50.895
Let's start by
throwing out this box.

38
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:53.226
Oh! Not that box!

39
00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:54.799
Do we really need this?

40
00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:57.062
That's my ship in a bottle.

41
00:01:57.248 --> 00:01:58.169
And this?

42
00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:00.565
That's my othership
in a bottle.

43
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:01.800
And these?

44
00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:04.432
They're my
otherships in bottles.

45
00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:06.011
I need them all.

46
00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:10.005
Well,
we have to throw something out.

47
00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:12.473
How about this box.

48
00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:14.847
No! Not my hats!

49
00:02:19.203 --> 00:02:22.650
Oh dear, we can't decide
what to throw out.

50
00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:23.592
I know!

51
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.687
We'll let Peppa
and George decide.

52
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.629
Ok!

53
00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.300
Let's throw away this old case.

54
00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:32.769
Ah! Not that one!

55
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.766
This isn't just any old case.

56
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.672
It's a record player.

57
00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:38.971
Oooooh.

58
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.809
And this was
ourfavourite record.

59
00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:43.109
Can we play it?

60
00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:43.909
Yes!

61
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.115
We haven't heard it for years.

62
00:02:54.138 --> 00:02:55.992
This takes me back.

63
00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:02.029
Come on, Peppa and George,
let's dance!

64
00:03:09.186 --> 00:03:11.802
Mummy Pig is here to pick up
Peppa and George.

65
00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:18.113
Hello? Where are you?

66
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.083
Mummy Pig can't find anyone.

67
00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:21.548
What's that noise?

68
00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:25.053
Mummy!

69
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:26.290
Hello!

70
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.889
We've been dancing to

71
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:30.792
Granny and Grandpa's
favorite record!

72
00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:31.760
Yes.

73
00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.691
Granny and Grandpa
played it all the time!

74
00:03:35.312 --> 00:03:36.097
Oh!

75
00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:38.101
And here's the record
I used to play,

76
00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:39.671
when I was a Little piggy.

77
00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:40.602
What is it?

78
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:41.605
It's called

79
00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.437
'Birdie Birdie Woof Woof'.

80
00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:46.011
Not "Birdie Birdie Woof Woof!".

81
00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:48.273
You were always playing that!

82
00:03:48.392 --> 00:03:50.974
I thought we'd thrown
that out ages ago.

83
00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:55.852
The birds go woof!

84
00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:57.479
And the dogs go tweet!

85
00:03:57.601 --> 00:03:58.283
Woof tweet!

86
00:03:58.402 --> 00:03:58.857
Woof tweet!

87
00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:00.322
Woof! Woof! Woof!

88
00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:01.449
The sheeps go moo!

89
00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:03.051
And the cows go baa!

90
00:04:03.174 --> 00:04:04.425
Moo Baa! Moo tweet!

91
00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:05.793
Moo Baa! Moo tweet!

92
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.263
Woof! Woof! Woof!

93
00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:10.792
Again again!

94
00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:14.930
The birds go woof!

95
00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:16.405
And the dogs go tweet!

96
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.066
Woof tweet!

97
00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:17.768
Woof tweet!

98
00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:19.173
Woof! Woof! Woof!

99
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.405
The sheeps go moo!

100
00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:21.980
And the cows go baa!

101
00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:23.411
Moo Baa! Moo tweet!

102
00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:24.710
Moo Baa! Moo tweet!

103
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:26.080
Woof! Woof! Woof!

104
00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:29.577
That was fun.

105
00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:30.745
But we were supposed to be

106
00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:33.348
finding some things
to throw out!

107
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.553
Peppa, what hould we throw out
and what should we keep?

108
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:41.096
Hmmm, I think you should
keep everything!
