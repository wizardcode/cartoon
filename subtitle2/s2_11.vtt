00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.400
The Boat Pond

2
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.600
The ducks are swimming in their pond.

3
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.800
They are very happy.

4
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Here are Peppa, George,
Mummy Pig, and Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400
Hello, ducks.

6
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.900
The ducks want some bread.

7
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.300
Sorry, Mrs. Duck.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
We haven't got any bread today.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We've got something much more fun.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Peppa has brought her toy boat,

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.900
and George has brought his toy boat.

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.300
Let's wind your boat up, George.

13
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.600
George's boat works with clockwork.

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.583
Quick, George, put the boat in the pond
before the clockwork runs out.

15
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.000
George loves his clockwork boat.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
Mummy, can you wind my boat up?

17
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.400
Your boat does not need winding up, Peppa.

18
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.900
Peppa. S boat is a sail boat,

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.900
the wind makes it go along.

20
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.200
I don't like my boat.

21
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.300
It doesn't do anything.

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.700
That's because there isn't any wind today.

23
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.900
Maybe you just need a little help.

24
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.600
I'll huff, and I'll puff,

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.583
and I'll blow your boat along.

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
Hooray, it went really fast.

27
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.000
Peppa loves her sail boat.

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.200
Here's Peppa's friend, Suzy Sheep.

29
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400
Hello, everyone.

30
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.100
Hello, Suzy.

31
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.900
We're playing with our boats.

32
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.400
I've got my speed boat.

33
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.200
Is it clockwork?

34
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.100
No, it has batteries.

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.083
Suzy's speed boat
uses batteries to make it go.

36
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.300
What a great speed boat!

37
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.200
Sorry, Mrs. Duck.

38
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.800
Here is Danny Dog,
with Granddad Dog.

39
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.900
Hello, everyone.

40
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.500
Hello, Danny.

41
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.483
My Granddad has made me
this paddle boat.

42
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.700
I'll say that is impressive.

43
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.200
How does it work?

44
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.000
It is steam powered.

45
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.983
I just push this little lever.

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.383
What a fantastic paddle boat!

47
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.600
Here is Rebecca Rabbit,
with her mummy.

48
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.500
Hello, everyone.

49
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.200
Hello, Rebecca.

50
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.183
We're playing with our boats.

51
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.700
I wish I had a boat.

52
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.000
Rebecca Rabbit does not have a boat.

53
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.400
I've got an idea.

54
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.100
Luckily I've brought my newspaper along.

55
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.500
I just need one page.

56
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.400
Which page can we use?

57
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.000
News, sports, ah, fashion.

58
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.100
Not the fashion page.

59
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.500
OK, I'll use the business page.

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.900
When I was a little piggy,

61
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.600
I used to fold newspaper like this.

62
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.800
What is Daddy Pig doing?

63
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.500
To make a paper boat.

64
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.600
Daddy Pig has made a paper boat.

65
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.900
Thank you, Mr. Pig.

66
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.200
George wants a paper boat too.

67
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.183
I suppose I can do that
with sports page.

68
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.800
Please, can I have one?

69
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.600
And me?

70
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.800
Of course.

71
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.100
Daddy Pig's making paper boats
for everyone.

72
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.800
Let's have a race.

73
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.600
Good idea, Mummy Pig.

74
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.500
We can huff, and puff,

75
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.900
and blow the paper boats across.

76
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.600
Everyone takes a deep breath.

77
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.583
Ready? Steady? Blow!

78
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600
We have a winner.

79
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.600
Who has this sports page?

80
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.600
That's George's boat.

81
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.800
George's the winner.

82
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.100
I like boats,
and I like paper boats the best.

83
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.300
Me too!

84
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.800
It is time to go home.

85
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.600
Everybody has had a great time.

86
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.900
Bye bye.

87
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.600
Bye bye, ducks.

88
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.200
See you soon.

89
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.000
The ducks enjoy the toy boats,

90
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.983
but they quite like having the pond back
to themselves again.
