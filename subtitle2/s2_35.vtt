00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:18.994
Jumble Sale

2
00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:24.810
It is a rainy day and the
school roof has a hole in it.

3
00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:27.604
Children!

4
00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:30.181
We are going to
have a jumble sale.

5
00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:34.116
The money we raise will pay for
a new school roof.

6
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.550
Horray!

7
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.453
Everyone has to bring something
for the jumble sale.

8
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.055
What should we bring?

9
00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:45.127
You can bring an old toy or
something you don't use anymore.

10
00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:50.294
The parents have arrived
to pick up the children.

11
00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:51.335
Home time!

12
00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.106
Don't forget your old toys
forthe jumble sale tomorrow.

13
00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:01.146
Peppa is choosing a toy
for the jumble sale.

14
00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:03.247
Peppa, have you decided?

15
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:04.373
Ummm...

16
00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:06.610
You only have to choose one toy.

17
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:10.679
Yes, and it will help pay
for a new school roof.

18
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:16.387
Ok. I'm going to give...
Mr. Dinosaur!

19
00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:17.656
Waaaaaaaaa!

20
00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:20.426
Mr. Dinosaur is
George's favourite toy.

21
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:23.092
Peppa, you can't
give away Mr. Dinosaur.

22
00:01:23.214 --> 00:01:24.135
Can't I?

23
00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:25.135
No.

24
00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:27.830
Oh bother! Sorry, George.

25
00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:30.472
Dine-saw.

26
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.708
Why don't you give
your old jack-in-a-box.

27
00:01:36.093 --> 00:01:36.843
Ok.

28
00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:39.150
Now, it's your turn, Daddy!

29
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.078
What?

30
00:01:41.732 --> 00:01:44.314
We must all give something to
the jumble sale.

31
00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:48.986
I'm giving this hat and
George is giving this ball.

32
00:01:49.507 --> 00:01:51.463
So what shall Daddy give?

33
00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:53.796
I know, the television?

34
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:55.094
Not the telly!

35
00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:57.394
No! It's too useful.

36
00:01:57.615 --> 00:01:59.799
Ummmm, I know.

37
00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:02.239
Daddy's smelly slippers?

38
00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:06.209
No! Too smelly.

39
00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:10.246
I know! Daddy's old chair.

40
00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:13.511
But that's an antique.

41
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.883
What does an-tique mean?

42
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.582
Antique means it's
very old and valuable.

43
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:21.251
But you found it on
a rubbish tip, Daddy Pig.

44
00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:22.452
It's worthless.

45
00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:24.825
It'll be worth a lot of
money when I mend it.

46
00:02:24.942 --> 00:02:27.797
You've been saying
that for ages, Daddy Pig.

47
00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:31.069
I know, I'll give these,

48
00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:33.536
lovely socks that
Granny Pig made me.

49
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:34.401
Good!

50
00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:41.974
I've come to collect yourthings
forthe jumble sale.

51
00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:43.113
Here they are.

52
00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:44.314
Thank you!

53
00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:48.954
And would you
like this old chair?

54
00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:53.753
Oh, most generous! Good-bye.

55
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:55.224
Bye bye.

56
00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.820
Mummy,
you gave away Daddy. S chair.

57
00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:01.400
Shhh! Don't tell him.
He'll never notice.

58
00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:05.634
It is the day of
the jumble sale.

59
00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:08.398
Hello.

60
00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:09.871
Hello, Miss Rabbit.

61
00:03:10.187 --> 00:03:12.166
Peppa! How about this chair?

62
00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:13.403
It's a bit rubbish

63
00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:15.810
but you can chop it up
and use it for firewood.

64
00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:17.882
But it' an antique.

65
00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:18.744
Is it?

66
00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:21.320
Daddy says it's
worth lots of money.

67
00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:22.420
Well, I never.

68
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:23.989
I'd better put the price up.

69
00:03:24.135 --> 00:03:25.056
Bye.

70
00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:27.884
Hello, everyone.

71
00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:29.083
Hello, Peppa.

72
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.060
What did you give, Suzy?

73
00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.325
I gave my nurse's outfit.

74
00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:35.594
I gave my parrot balloon.

75
00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:37.897
I gave my toy monkey.

76
00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:45.066
I will miss my jack-in-a-box.

77
00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:48.871
Can I buy this jack-in-abox,
please?

78
00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:51.948
And I'd like
this nurse's outfit.

79
00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:54.280
The parrot balloon, please.

80
00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:59.391
Mummy, mummy,
look what we've bought.

81
00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:01.084
All your old toys!

82
00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:02.627
We missed them.

83
00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.390
Look what I've bought!
Lt. S an antique chair!

84
00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:09.797
Oh, Daddy Pig!

85
00:04:09.914 --> 00:04:11.768
That's not an antique chair.

86
00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:14.203
It is! Miss Rabbit just said so.

87
00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.068
And it matches my old one.

88
00:04:16.187 --> 00:04:18.803
Yes, Daddy, that's because...

89
00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.072
Shhh! Peppa.

90
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:22.648
...it is your old chair.

91
00:04:23.427 --> 00:04:24.109
What?

92
00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:27.413
But Miss Rabbit has just
charged me lots of money for it!

93
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:29.988
Fantasic news, everybody.

94
00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:32.022
We have just
raised all the money

95
00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:34.855
we need fora new school roof.

96
00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:36.360
Horray!

97
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:38.593
Thank you, Daddy Pig.

98
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.696
You're most welcome.
