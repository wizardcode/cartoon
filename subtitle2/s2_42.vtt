Ice skating

2
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.400
Peppa and her family are
going to ice skating today.

3
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.800
This will be fun.

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.700
Peppa and George has never
been ice skating before.

5
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.900
Now George,

6
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.883
you won't be a very good at ice
skating so just do what I do.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.600
I am sure we'll all be very good.

8
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.100
Yes. Especially me

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.500
First, we need some skates.

10
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.400
At the ice rink,
everyone wear skates.

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.800
Hello, Ms. Rabbit.

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.000
Hello, mummy pig.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.700
We'd like to hire
some skates, please.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.700
There you go.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.900
Thank you.

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.800
Happy skating.

17
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.283
Peppa's friends can
ice-skate very well.

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.100
Peppa wants to ice-skate, too.

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.500
Hello, everyone.

23
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.100
Hello, peppa.

24
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.900
Is this yourfirst time skating?

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.200
Yes.

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.100
Shall I show you how you skate?

27
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.900
No, thank you, Suzy,

28
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.700
I am sure I can already do it.

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.683
Okay, come on then.

30
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.500
This is impossible.

31
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.300
I don't want to
ice-skating anymore.

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.000
Don't worry, Peppa.

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Everyone falls over
when they ice-skate.

34
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.200
Even I fall over.

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
Watch this, oopsy daisy!

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.800
Silly daddy.

37
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.400
George, would you like to skate?

38
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400
No.

39
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.200
George has never skated before,

40
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.000
and he is a bit worried.

41
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.983
I'll look after George while
you teach peppa how to skate.

42
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.100
Skating is easy, peppa.

43
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.900
Just push with yourfeet and glide.

44
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.300
Push, push, glide. See?

45
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.500
Push, push, glide.

46
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.400
This is easy,

47
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.900
I can do it on my
own now, mummy

48
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.200
Push, push, glide.

49
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.800
Well done, Peppa.

50
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.500
Look at me, I'm skating.

51
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.900
Peppa is doing really well.

52
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.883
Yes, I am a very good teacher.

53
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.000
Slow down, Peppa,

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.900
you'll bump into someone.

55
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.500
Don't worry, mummy,

56
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
I am very good at skating.

57
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.700
Oh, where are the brakes?

58
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.200
Oh, dear.

59
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.600
I forgot to teach Peppa
how to stop.

60
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.100
Oh... ah, I can not stop.

61
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.083
Look out.

62
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.800
Mummy pig taught you
how to skate,

63
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.000
but I taught you
how to fall over.

64
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.983
Yes, I am very
good at falling over.

65
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.500
George, do you
want to skate too?

66
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500
No.

67
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Come on, George, it's fun.

68
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.200
I'll teach you.

69
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.500
First, you need to.

70
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.400
Weeeee...

71
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400
George, come back,

72
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.383
I'm teaching you
how to ice-skate.

73
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.400
What a surprise!

74
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.500
George can skate beautifully.

75
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.483
Wow look at George.

76
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.700
Very good, George.

77
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.683
Now you need to
learn how to stop.

78
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.500
Well done, George.

79
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800
You're fantastic, George!

80
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.900
Yes, you did very well, George,

81
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.500
foryour first lesson.

82
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.600
Come on, let's skate.

83
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.000
Yes...

84
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.900
Peppa and George
love ice-skating,

85
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.600
everyone love ice-skating.

86
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.100
Mummy and Daddy taught me
how to skate,

87
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.083
but I taught George.
