The Baby Piggy

2
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.701
Peppa and George are visiting
their big cousin Chloe.

3
00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:25.769
Today,
as well as seeing Chloe,

4
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040
you are going to
meet your new cousin.

5
00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:29.280
Oooh!

6
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.050
Peppa and herfamily have
arrived at Chloe's house.

7
00:00:33.164 --> 00:00:33.846
Hello!

8
00:00:33.964 --> 00:00:34.851
Hello, everyone!

9
00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:36.847
Hello, Peppa and George!

10
00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.549
This is Chloe,
Peppa and George's big cousin.

11
00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:41.859
But where's our new cousin?

12
00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.791
Here's your new baby cousin!

13
00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:45.387
Ooh!

14
00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:48.501
The new cousin is a tiny,
baby piggy.

15
00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:53.071
Ooh! How beautiful!

16
00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:54.663
Is it a girl baby?

17
00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:56.707
No, it's a boy.

18
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.777
Oh. I wish it was a girl.

19
00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:59.969
Me, too.

20
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.970
George is pleased
the baby is a boy.

21
00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:04.378
Dine-Saw!

22
00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:07.119
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

23
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.052
I think the baby's too Little
to play with dinosaurs.

24
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:10.952
George.

25
00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:13.457
The baby doesn't
want to play with you.

26
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:15.755
It wants to play with me.

27
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.760
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

28
00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:22.562
Peppa, the baby is much
too Little to play ball games.

29
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.434
But if it can't play with
a dinosauror a ball,

30
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.767
what can it do?

31
00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:29.807
It eats and it sleeps.

32
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.306
Burp!

33
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.934
And it does that.

34
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:36.712
Aunty Pig, can I hold the baby?

35
00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:37.373
Yes.

36
00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:40.850
If you're very careful,
you can hold Alexander.

37
00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.250
Alexander?

38
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.551
That's his name,
"Baby Alexander'.

39
00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.352
What a big name
forsuch a small piggy.

40
00:01:48.472 --> 00:01:51.953
It's quite nice,
even though it's a boy.

41
00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:56.763
Oh. What's that smell?

42
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.237
Maybe Alexander's
nappy needs changing.

43
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:02.740
Euggh! Disgusting!

44
00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:06.300
Peppa, when you were
a baby you wore nappies.

45
00:02:06.423 --> 00:02:08.038
I did not.

46
00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:12.874
Mummy, can I play with Peppa
and George in the garden?

47
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.046
Yes.

48
00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:22.055
Chloe, is it nice having
a Little baby brother?

49
00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:25.027
Yes. Alexander is very sweet.

50
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.358
I wish George was
a sweet Little baby piggy.

51
00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.195
I know!

52
00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:32.237
George can pretend to
be a baby piggy.

53
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.536
He can go in my doll's pram.

54
00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:35.937
That's a good idea!

55
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.934
No!

56
00:02:37.054 --> 00:02:39.067
George does not
want to be a baby.

57
00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.110
George.

58
00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:42.180
If you pretend to be a baby,

59
00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:46.047
I promise to be nice
to you for everand ever.

60
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.049
George is thinking.

61
00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:50.315
And you can play
with all my toys.

62
00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:51.955
George is thinking more.

63
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.425
And when we get home,
you can play with all my toys.

64
00:02:56.507 --> 00:02:58.361
George has decided! Goo goo goo!

65
00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:00.960
What a sweet baby piggy.

66
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.735
Here are Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep,

67
00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.828
Rebecca Rabbit
and Zoe Zebra.

68
00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:08.804
Hello!

69
00:03:09.853 --> 00:03:12.777
Why is George
in that doll's pram?

70
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.007
It's not George.
It's a baby piggy.

71
00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:18.682
But it is George.

72
00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:21.515
George is a pretend baby piggy.

73
00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:22.951
Ahhhhh!

74
00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:24.921
Is it a girl ora boy?

75
00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.115
It's a girl.

76
00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:27.153
No!

77
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:29.819
George does not
want to be a girl baby.

78
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.692
Ok. It's a boy.

79
00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:34.663
I've got some cookies.

80
00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:37.064
Would the baby piggy like one?

81
00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:40.263
Oh no. It can't eat cookies.

82
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.338
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

83
00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:43.033
George likes cookies!

84
00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:45.610
Maybe it can have one cookie.

85
00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:49.840
It's so clever!

86
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.848
And so handsome!

87
00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:52.815
Buuuurrrp!

88
00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:55.546
It's very funny!

89
00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:58.749
It's the best baby piggy ever!

90
00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.449
George likes this game.

91
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.488
Here is Aunty Pig
with Baby Alexander.

92
00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:09.065
Wow! A proper, real baby piggy!

93
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.869
It's so gorgeous!

94
00:04:12.983 --> 00:04:15.440
It's much sweeterthan George.

95
00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:16.873
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

96
00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:19.876
Oh dear. George liked
being the baby piggy.

97
00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:21.309
Oh, George!

98
00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:24.041
You'll always be my baby piggy.

99
00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.508
Maybe it's time for a new game.

100
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:30.418
How about some dinosaur chasing!

101
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.020
Eeek! Too scary!

102
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:39.654
George liked being a baby piggy,

103
00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:42.227
but he likes being George more.
