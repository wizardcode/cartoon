Suzy Sheep has come to
play with Peppa.

3
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Hello Peppa!
Hello Suzy!

4
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.100
This is my new friend, Leo Lion.

5
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.300
Where is he?
There is no one there.

6
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Suzy has made up a pretend friend.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
Can't you see him, Peppa?

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.700
Uh...

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Let's play catch.

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
OK! To you, Leo.

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Peppa throws the ball to
Suzy's pretend friend.

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.300
Leo cannot catch the ball.

13
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.100
He can, he just doesn't
like playing catch.

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.300
What does Leo like directly.

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
He likes to roar.

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.700
Is he going to roaror not?

17
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Yes, Roar...

18
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.400
Wasn't that you?

19
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.700
No, that was Leo.

20
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.400
Ah... Hello Leo!

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Peppa pretend that
she can see Leo Lion.

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.500
Leo, Will you be my friend too?

23
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
What did he say?

24
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900
He is nodding his head.

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.700
That means yes!

26
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.683
Peppa, Suzy, Would you like to come
inside to have some fruit cake?

27
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.600
Mummy Pig has two slices of fruit cake
to Suzy and Peppa.

28
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.600
Mummy, Suzy's got a pretend friend,
he is called Leo Lion.

29
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.800
I see,
and does he like fruit cake too?

30
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Roar... Leo love fruit cake.

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.783
Don't be silly, Peppa.
That wasn't Leo, That was you!

32
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.400
Leo prefers chocolate cake.

33
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.000
I haven't got chocolate cake.
Will Leo have some fruit cake?

34
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.600
Roar...
He will try a little slice.

35
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.583
Mummy Pig gives some cake
to Suzy's pretend friend.

36
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500
George is playing with Mr. Dinosaur.

37
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100
Dinosaur...

38
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.800
George, you are sitting on Leo.

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.900
George does not know that
Suzy has a pretend friend.

40
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.883
Roar...

41
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.283
Leo Lion said he cannot finish his cake,
so George can have it.

42
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.500
Can we play upstairs now?

43
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.300
Yes. Let's play dressing up.

44
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.100
I was asking Leo.

45
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.700
Oh...

46
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700
Leo says he likes playing dressing up.

47
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.683
Good. Come on Leo.

I grant you one wish.

51
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.900
My wish is to be Queen Suzy.

52
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.300
And Leo Lion will be the jester.

53
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.700
He doesn't want to be the jester.

54
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.400
He wants to be the King.

55
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.300
Here is the Daddy Pig.

56
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.800
Mummy Pig tells me
you have a very special visiter.

57
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.400
It's only Suzy, Daddy.

58
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.100
Are you sure there
isn't someone else, Peppa?

59
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.083
There is someone else.
King Leo Lion. Roar...

60
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.200
It's an honor to meet you,
King Leo.

61
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.800
Daddy Pig pretends
he can see King Leo.

62
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.100
May I say what a fine golden mine you have!

63
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.083
Yes, it's very fine,
and he is wearing his best red trousers.

64
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
Oh, yes!

65
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.500
And his blue jumper.

66
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.483
Silly Peppa, Leo isn't wearing a blue jumper,
he is wearing his best green shirt!

67
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.800
Well, if it's sort of a bluei - green.

68
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.200

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.983
Yes!

72
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.400
Are you sure Leo should jumping puddles
without his boots?

73
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.300
Oh! I forgot!

74
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.000
Leo is wearing his boots as well.

75
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.983
