00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.600
Dens

2
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.100
Peppa and George are in granny
and granpa pig's garden.

3
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.500
They are going to play
in theirtree house.

4
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.900
Peppa and George
love their tree house.

5
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.800
Here are peppa and George's friends.

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.600
Zoe, Suzy, Rebecca and Richard.

7
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.900
I like your tree house, peppa.

8
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
Can we come in?

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.400
Yes.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.383
Now we can have a tea party.

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.300
Here are Pedro and Danny.

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.600
Hello, Peppa.

13
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.800
Can we come in?

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.900
Sorry, Danny,

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.700
only girls can come into
the tree house.

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.300
Boys are a bit noisy,

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.000
they always spoiled the tea parties.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But George and Richard are the boys.

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Oh, yes,

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800
sorry, George,

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.783
this tree house is forthe girls only.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.700
What's wrong?

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.100
The girls won't let us
into the tree house.

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.600
It isn't fair.

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
I think I can help,

26
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.100
come over here.

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.083
Now we can have a
nice quiet tea party.

28
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.500
What's that noisy?

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.300
There,

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.283
Now you boys have your very own den
and very old drawbridge.

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.400
A castle,

32
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.383
thank you, grandpa pig.

33
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.300
Can we come in?

34
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.700
No, this is the boy's den,

35
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.500
for boys only.

36
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.000
But I love castles.

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.700
Castles aren't as good as tree houses.

38
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.400
Come on, girls.

39
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.600
I'm the king of the castles.

40
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.300
Every castle needs a flag.

41
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.600
Wow.

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600
They've got a flag.

43
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
We don't need a silly flag.

44
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.300
Here is granny pig.

45
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.500
Hello, girls,

46
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.800
can I get you anything.

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Aflag, please.

48
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.500
And it must be better
than the boy's flag.

49
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.400
I'll see what I can do.

50
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.900
I am the king of the castle.

51
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.300
Every castle needs a telephone.

52
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.700
Hold this.

53
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.683
Keep this string nice and tight
and you can talk to the boys.

54
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.700
We don't want to talk to the boys.

55
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.683
We don't want to talk to the girls.

56
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.100
Granny pig has found a flag
for the girl's den.

57
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.600
This dress will make a pretty flag.

58
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.500
Thank you, granny.

59
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500
It isn't as good as the boy's flag.

60
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.300
I wish I were in the castle.

61
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.100
Fairy Princess is live in the castles.

62
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.300
If I were fairy princess,

63
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.200
I would live in the tree house.

64
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.500
Can we come over, please.

65
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.300
Only if you say the castle is the best.

66
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.100
It is the best.

67
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.083
I'm staying in my tree house.

68
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400
I love the castle.

69
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.300
Oh, dear, it is raining,

70
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.800
and the castle has no roof.

71
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.900
Let's go to the tree house.

72
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.883
No, I'll never leave my castle.

73
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.100
The rain has stopped.

74
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.400
George has found a muddy puddle.

75
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.383
That looks fun.

76
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.500
I'm staying in my castle.

77
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.300
I'm staying in my tree house.

78
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.500
I'll look afteryourcastle, Danny.

79
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.483
I'll look afteryourtree house, Peppa.

80
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.100
Peppa and Danny love jumping up
and down in muddy puddles,

81
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.000
Everyone loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles

82
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.983
whetherthey are boys orgirls.
