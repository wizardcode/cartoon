00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
The Powercut

2
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.900
It is evening.

3
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.600
Peppa and George are in the sitting room
dancing to their favourite song.

4
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.600
Daddy pig is in the hallway
vacuuming the carpet.

5
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600
And Mummy pig is in her study,

6
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
doing her important work on her computer.

7
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.583
OH!

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.100
Mummy, daddy,

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
it's gone all dark and the music is broken.

10
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.800
And my vacuum won't work.

11
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.100
And my computer has switched off.

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.900
Mummy pig tries the light switch.

13
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.800
But the lights do not come on.

14
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
It must be a power cut.

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.700
What's a power cut?

16
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.200
A power cut is when there is no electricity.

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
What's the electricity?

18
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.700
Electricity is what makes everything
in our house work.

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.500
Will electricity come back again?

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800
Yes, but in the meantime,

21
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.700
we need to find a torch.

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.600
I think there's a torch is in the cellar...

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Ok, I'll go and get it.

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.500
Will you be okay, daddy?

25
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.000
Hoho, I'll be fine.

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.700
I can see very well in the dark.

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.000
Who put that there...

28
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.600
Oh.

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.100
Daddy! Are you okay?

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.100
Yeah, it's just a bit dark down here.

31
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100
Oh, I just remembered.

32
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.100
I think the torch is in the kitchen.

33
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
Aha, mummy pig has found the touch.

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
Can I hold the torch, mummy?

35
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.900
Okay!

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.400
George! Look at me!

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.000
Peppa is making a funny face.

38
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.900
Don't worry, George, it's only Peppa.

39
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.900
Oh, we'd bettertold daddy we found the torch.

40
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.300
Daddy is still in the cellar,

41
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000
looking forthe torch.

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
I am sure it is here somewhere.

43
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.000
Daddy, we've found the torch.

44
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.400
Luckily, it was in the kitchen all the time.

45
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.800
What a stroke of luck!

46
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.200
Now we just have to wait until
the electricity comes back.

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.600
How long will that be, exactly?

48
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.500
I would say, exactly a long time.

49
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.483
Oh, but George and I
want to do some dancing.

50
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900
I know what we can do.

51
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.200
We can watch the television.

52
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.000
Oh, it won't go on.

53
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.800
The tv needs electricity too.

54
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.700
Does it?

55
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.100
Yes.

56
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.600
Oh, now what are we going to do?

57
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.300
In the olden days
when there was no television

58
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.000
children would have to
made up theirown games.

59
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.600
I know, I need a cardboard box.

60
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
What is Peppa doing?

61
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.600
Mummy, would you cut a hole
in this box for me?

62
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.500
What for?

63
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.000
You'll see.

64
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Mummy pig is cutting a hole
in the cardboard box.

65
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
There you are, Peppa.

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.600
Thank you.

67
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.300
No you all have to sit down there,

68
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.600
and George,

69
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.583
you have to point this torch on me.

70
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.983
Welcome to Peppa pig news
with me, Peppa pig.

71
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.800
Peppa has made herown television.

72
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.000
Today the whole world stop working

73
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.983
when there was a powercut
and all the electricity was lost.

74
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
Very good, Peppa.

75
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.283
Daddy pig says the electricity won't be back
fora long long time.

76
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.300
Oh, the electricity is back.

77
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.700
Hooray!

78
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.400
SHush! I haven't finished yet.

79
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.200
Switch the lights off.

80
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.000
Okay, Peppa.

81
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.700
Good.

82
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.000
I have some very important news.

83
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.200
The queen has just found
some more electricity

84
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.400
and says that everyone
can now be happy again.

85
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.100
Every good, Peppa!

86
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.100
Hooray!

87
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.600
Let's dance!

88
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.800
Peppa quite enjoyed the powercut.

89
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.783
But she's happy the electricity is back again.
