00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:17.840
Peppa's Christmas

2
00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:19.417
It is Christmas Eve.

3
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.845
Peppa and George
are going to

4
00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:22.785
post their letters
to Father Christmas.

5
00:00:30.374 --> 00:00:31.557
Here are Peppa's friends.

6
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.297
Race you to the post box!

7
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.135
The children are all posting
letters to Father Christmas.

8
00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:44.234
What have you all asked
FatherChristmas for?

9
00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:46.338
A scooter.

10
00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:48.276
A toy spaceship.

11
00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:49.676
A Little guitar.

12
00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:50.976
Atoy mouse.

13
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.141
A skipping rope.

14
00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:53.274
A trumpet.

15
00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:55.649
A bat and ball.

16
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.122
George has asked
for a toy train.

17
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:03.485
And I would love... a yoyo.

18
00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:08.265
It is Mr. Zebra the Postman.

19
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.701
My goodness!
A lot of post today!

20
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.431
They're all our letters
to Father Christmas.

21
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.032
It's very important that
FatherChristmas gets them.

22
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.804
He lives at the North Pole.

23
00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:21.777
Yes, I can see that.

24
00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.911
Well, if I'm off to
the North Pole today,

25
00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:28.647
I can't stand
around chattering. Bye!

26
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.812
Bye!

27
00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.620
PEPPA! GEORGE!

28
00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:35.724
We're off to get
the Christmas tree!

29
00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:36.692
Horray!

30
00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:38.893
Is everybody ready?

31
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.397
Yes, Daddy Pig!

32
00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:42.224
Then let's go!!!

33
00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.531
This is Miss Rabbit's Tree Shop.

34
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:51.833
Hello, Miss Rabbit.

35
00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:53.205
Hello, there!

36
00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:55.439
We'd like to buy a tree, please.

37
00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:57.277
What sort are you looking for?

38
00:01:57.394 --> 00:01:57.974
Please don't say,

39
00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:00.416
an apple tree
or a cherry tree",

40
00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:01.747
I don't have them.

41
00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.379
We want a Christmas tree.

42
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.183
Phew.

43
00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:06.951
I've got hundreds of them.

44
00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.020
These are the Littlest ones.

45
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:12.463
We were looking for
something bigger.

46
00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:14.822
This is our mid range.

47
00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:16.658
Still not big enough.

48
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.133
Are you sure, Daddy Pig?

49
00:02:18.248 --> 00:02:19.761
They look lovely to me.

50
00:02:19.883 --> 00:02:22.841
And this is our biggest tree.

51
00:02:23.053 --> 00:02:24.031
Perfect.

52
00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:25.200
Jolly good.

53
00:02:25.322 --> 00:02:27.779
I'll ask Mr. Bull
to carry it to yourcar.

54
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.039
Mr. Bull!!!

55
00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:32.846
Hello, everyone!

56
00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:36.013
Big tree this one.

57
00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:37.583
Got a big car?

58
00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:39.383
Er, yes.

59
00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:41.556
So, where's your car?

60
00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:42.919
This is it.

61
00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:44.058
Oh.

62
00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:46.893
Our car is quite small,
isn't it?

63
00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:51.566
Daddy's just going to have
to choose a smaller tree.

64
00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:55.038
No need forthat!
I'll carry it home.

65
00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.334
It can't be that heavy.

66
00:02:57.521 --> 00:02:58.738
See you later!

67
00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.403
See you later!

68
00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:02.210
Bye!

69
00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:03.472
Bye!

70
00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:09.246
Daddy's been gone for ages!

71
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.021
I hope our tree is ok.

72
00:03:13.704 --> 00:03:15.217
What's that noise?

73
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.489
It's Daddy!

74
00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:19.096
With our tree!

75
00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:23.424
Horray!

76
00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.735
Daddy, was the tree heavy?

77
00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:30.500
It was a bit heavy, yes.

78
00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:33.502
I hope the tree fits
in our house.

79
00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:37.007
Don't worry,
I'll make sure it fits.

80
00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:40.180
It is a lovely tree.

81
00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:43.512
Thank you for carrying it
all the way home, Daddy Pig.

82
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.282
You're most welcome.

83
00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:47.151
Let's get it decorated!

84
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:49.193
Peppa puts the glitter
on the tree.

85
00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:51.262
It's so glittery!

86
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:52.922
George hangs the baubles.

87
00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:57.125
Mummy Pig fixes
the fairy lights.

88
00:03:58.182 --> 00:04:01.538
And Daddy Pig puts a star
on the very top of the tree.

89
00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:02.605
There!

90
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.035
Oooooohhh!

91
00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:08.238
Little star on
the Christmas Tree Goes,

92
00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:12.840
Twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle twee.

93
00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:14.814
What a charming song.

94
00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:18.857
And all the Little piggies
on Christmas Eve Go,

95
00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.756
"Oink! Oink! Oink!
Oink! Snort! '

96
00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:23.089
Lovely, Peppa.

97
00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:24.162
Now, it's time to...

98
00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:25.753
Wait, there's more!

99
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.863
Oink! Oink! Oink! Oink!

100
00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:28.899
Snort!

101
00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:34.733
Sweet Little star on
the Christmas Treeeee...

102
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:36.807
Maybe that's enough singing.

103
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:39.405
Do you know
what day tomorrow is?

104
00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:41.002
Christmas Day!

105
00:04:42.392 --> 00:04:44.849
Here's a Little snack
for Father Christmas.

106
00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:45.744
Daddy?

107
00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:49.377
Why does Father Christmas
come down the chimney?

108
00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.889
Why doesn't he
just use the front door?

109
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.627
Good question, Peppa.

110
00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:57.957
If you see him, you should ask.

111
00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:02.500
But Father Christmas won't come
unless you're asleep in bed.

112
00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:03.496
Up you go!

113
00:05:06.483 --> 00:05:10.840
I hope Mr. Zebra gave
our letters to Father Christmas.

114
00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:12.342
I'm sure he did.

115
00:05:12.823 --> 00:05:14.541
Danny wanted a spaceship.

116
00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:16.376
Suzy, a scooter.

117
00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:17.744
Pedro, a guitar...

118
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:20.841
Can you remembereverything
yourfriends asked for?

119
00:05:20.964 --> 00:05:22.818
Of course, I can, Daddy.

120
00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:24.753
It's very important.

121
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.755
Goodnight my Little piggies.

122
00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:29.018
Sleep well.

123
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.519
George!

124
00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:37.767
Let's stay awake all night
and see Father Christmas!

125
00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:40.764
George is asleep.

126
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:46.100
I'm going to stay wide
awake all night...

127
00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.115
Peppa is asleep.

128
00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.175
What was that,
flying past the window?

129
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.314
Oh!?

130
00:05:57.434 --> 00:05:58.787
And what was that noise?

131
00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:00.748
George!

132
00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:04.227
There's a loud banging noise
coming from the roof!

133
00:06:07.978 --> 00:06:09.730
It is Father Christmas!

134
00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:12.030
Ho ho ho!

135
00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:15.331
Father Christmas just has
a few more presents to deliver.

136
00:06:15.652 --> 00:06:17.506
Peppa wants a yoyo.

137
00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:19.903
George wants a train.

138
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:26.376
Why do they make
these chimneys so small!

139
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:28.347
Oh no!

140
00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:30.784
Father Christmas
has lost his list!

141
00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:32.755
Oooph!

142
00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:36.620
Why are these chimneys
always so sooty?

143
00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:42.000
Ah! I see someone's left me
a mince pie and a drink!

144
00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.332
Delicious!

145
00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:47.438
Ho ho ho!

146
00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:51.700
George! It's Father Christmas!

147
00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:54.244
Ah! Hello, there!

148
00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:56.404
And who might you be?

149
00:06:56.593 --> 00:06:57.810
I'm Peppa.

150
00:06:57.994 --> 00:07:01.213
And who is this very
smart young gentleman?

151
00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:03.287
It's only George.

152
00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:05.617
Pleased to meet you, George.

153
00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:10.820
Are those presents for
George and me?

154
00:07:11.108 --> 00:07:12.154
They might be.

155
00:07:13.243 --> 00:07:14.824
Can we open them now!

156
00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:17.228
You have to wait till morning.

157
00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:19.033
FatherChristmas?

158
00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.129
How do you know what presents
to give everyone.

159
00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:23.900
I have a list!

160
00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:25.141
Er.

161
00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:28.110
Which I seem to have...
Iost.

162
00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:28.680
Oh!

163
00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:31.772
And I only had
a few more to deliver.

164
00:07:31.895 --> 00:07:35.342
To Suzy Sheep,
Danny Dog, Pedro Pony...

165
00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:36.545
That's easy!

166
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.713
Suzy wants a scooter.

167
00:07:38.835 --> 00:07:40.382
Danny, a spaceship.

168
00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:41.857
Pedro, a guitar.

169
00:07:41.972 --> 00:07:43.655
Emily, a toy mouse.

170
00:07:43.774 --> 00:07:45.628
Zoe, a bat and ball.

171
00:07:45.742 --> 00:07:47.425
Candy, a skipping rope.

172
00:07:47.544 --> 00:07:50.229
And Rebecca, a trumpet.

173
00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:51.598
Thank you, Peppa.

174
00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:53.535
You're most welcome.

175
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.298
Right!

176
00:07:54.418 --> 00:07:56.841
Let's get these
last presents delivered,

177
00:07:56.953 --> 00:08:01.071
which means climbing back up
this confounded chimney.

178
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.340
Father Christmas.

179
00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:05.310
Why don't you
use the front door?

180
00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:07.613
Galloping Goblins!

181
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:09.449
What a good idea!

182
00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.414
Bye bye, Peppa and George!

183
00:08:12.536 --> 00:08:13.389
Bye bye!

184
00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:17.723
Happy Christmas! Ho ho ho!

185
00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:27.167
Wake up, Peppa and George!

186
00:08:27.284 --> 00:08:28.933
It's Christmas day!

187
00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:30.933
Daddy, Mummy!

188
00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:33.238
We saw Father Christmas!

189
00:08:33.423 --> 00:08:35.345
And he left us these presents.

190
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:39.310
George has a toy train.

191
00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.509
Choo! Choo!

192
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.218
Peppa has...

193
00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.551
A Yoyo!

194
00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:47.387
Choo! Choo!

195
00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:51.094
All of Peppa's friends are here.

196
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:53.190
Happy Christmas, Peppa!

197
00:08:53.343 --> 00:08:55.129
Happy Christmas, everyone!

198
00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:57.896
I got a scooter!

199
00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:00.101
I got a spaceship!

200
00:09:00.984 --> 00:09:02.303
A Little guitar!

201
00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:03.940
Atoy mouse!

202
00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:07.005
A bat and ball!

203
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:08.737
A skipping rope!

204
00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:10.372
A trumpet!

205
00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:15.051
Everyone got what they wanted.

206
00:09:15.165 --> 00:09:17.622
Father Christmas is very clever!

207
00:09:17.868 --> 00:09:22.259
Well, actually it was me who
told him what you all wanted.

208
00:09:22.372 --> 00:09:23.885
Don't be silly, Peppa.

209
00:09:24.007 --> 00:09:24.985
It's true!

210
00:09:25.108 --> 00:09:27.656
George and I saw
Father Christmas.

211
00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:30.899
Here are Granny and Grandpa Pig.

212
00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:33.232
Happy Christmas, everyone!

213
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.829
Happy Christmas!

214
00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:36.433
I say!

215
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.009
Look at those big boot prints!

216
00:09:39.222 --> 00:09:40.507
Ooohh!

217
00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:44.473
And there's more of the same
boot prints on our roof!

218
00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:46.414
You see! It's true.

219
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.714
I saw Father Christmas.

220
00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:50.287
Woow!

221
00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:52.782
Happy Christmas, Peppa!

222
00:09:54.538 --> 00:09:55.857
Can't catch me!

223
00:09:59.109 --> 00:10:00.690
Can't catch me!

224
00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:11.305
This is the best Christmas ever!
