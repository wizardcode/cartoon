00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.700
Captain Daddy Pig

2
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.100
Peppa and her family are
borrowing grandpa's boat for the day.

3
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
Remember, Daddy Pig,

4
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.200
push the lever forward to go forward.

5
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.600
Aye-aye, Grandpa Pig.

6
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.500
Forward.

7
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.700
And back to go back.

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
And Back, simple.

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.900
And please look after my boat,

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.000
I just had it painted.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400
Oh, Grandpa Pig,

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.900
what an old fusspot you are.

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.300
Are my crew ready?

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.400
Yes, captain Daddy Pig.

15
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.900
Then let's go.

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.700
Oh, the boat is moving backwards.

17
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.200
Ah, watch out forthe bridge.

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
Oops!

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Oh, that was close.

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.900
Byebye. Byebye.

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.500
Have a lovely time.

22
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.200
I hope my boat comes back in one piece.

23
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.000
Stop worrying, It will be fine.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Peppa, ring the bell.

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.983
Aye-aye, captain daddy.

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.200
I am a bit hungry.

27
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.400
So am I.

28
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.500
Granpa has left us a picnic in the galley.

29
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.700
What's a galley?

30
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.600
A galley is the boat's little kitchen.

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.500
Follow me.

32
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.100
Peppa and George go inside the boat.

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.700
Wow, what a tiny little kitchen.

34
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.200
Where's the picnic?

35
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.700
That obvious place would be here.

36
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.900
That's not the picnic.

37
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.500
And it must be here.

38
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.800
And that's not the picnic.

39
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.900
This kitchen has everything in the wrong place.

40
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.800
Wow! ATV.

41
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
Daddy can not find the picnic.

42
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.700
It's impossible.

43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.900
If this was my kitchen,

44
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.400
the picnic would be here,

45
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.600
Well done, Peppa,

46
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.583
Peppa has found the picnic.

47
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.000
Delicious!

48
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.300
Oh, it's the ducks.

49
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.000
Hello, Mrs. Duck.

50
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900
Would you like some bread?

51
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
Peppa and George love feeding bread to ducks.

52
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.400
Look out, long reeds ahead.

53
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.383
Don't worry, grandpa's boat
will easily go through them.

54
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.400
Are we stuck?

55
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.200
No, we can reverse.

56
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.500
Now are we stuck?

57
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.300
Yes.

58
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.300
Oh, dear,

59
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.600
grandpa's boat is stuck in the reeds.

60
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.500
I'll just give it a little push.

61
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.200
Do be careful, Daddy Pig.

62
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400
I know what I'm doing.

63
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.500
When I say go, start the engine.

64
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.800
Aye-aye, captain Daddy Pig.

65
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
Go!

66
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.700
Daddy Pig has pushed the boat out of the reeds.

67
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.500
Hooray!

68
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.000
Quick, daddy,

69
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.200
jump back on the boat.

70
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, no,

71
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Daddy Pig is being left behind.

72
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.800
Swim faster, daddy.

73
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.700
Stop the engine.

74
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.900
What's he saying?

75
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.600
Stop the engine.

76
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.200
Daddy says, stop the engine.

77
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.800
Oh!

78
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.200
Are you ok, Daddy Pig?

79
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.000
Yes, I'm fine.

80
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.500
But let's head for home before
we have any more adventures.

81
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.300
Aye -aye, captain Daddy Pig.

82
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.600
They've been gone for ages.

83
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.800
I hope my boat's alright.

84
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.500
Look, there they are.

85
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.400
Hello.

86
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
Hi, There!

87
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.300
I'll just park the boat.

88
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.900
You park a car, but you moor a boat,

89
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.100
I'll show you.

90
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.400
Grandpa Pig is going to moorthe boat.

91
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.383
The secret of mooring is to do it carefully.

92
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.000
My, the bridge.

93
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.700
What?

94
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.900
Look behind you.

95
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.900
Ah!

96
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.900
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

97
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.700
Grandpa has broken his boat.

98
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.300
Never mind, Grandpa Pig.

99
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.900
You can have lots of fun mending it.

100
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.300
It is true that I love mending things.

101
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.700
Can I help mend the boat, Grandpa Pig?

102
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.683
Of course you can, Peppa.
