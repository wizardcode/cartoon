00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.100
The Eye Test

2
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.000
Peppa and George
are playing with Pedro Pony.

3
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.983
They are going to
jump in muddy puddles.

4
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.900
Pedro has slipped
and lost his glasses.

5
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
Where are my glasses?

6
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.883
Without glasses
Pedro can not see very well.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
George has found Pedro's glasses.

8
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.500
Ooooh!

9
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.700
Silly George.

10
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.800
Here they are.

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
Thank you.

12
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400
Pedro, Why do you wearglasses?

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.700
I need to.

14
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
The optician says so.

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.900
What's an optician?

16
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
My daddy is an optician,

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.300
he checks that you can see clearly.

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.100
How?

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Does he look inside your head?

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.800
He does an eye test.

21
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.900
Shall I give you an eye test?

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.300
Yes, give me an eye test.

23
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.700
OK.

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.300
Hmmm, interesting!

25
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.000
Close one eye
and say what you see.

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.800
I can see George.

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.700
Now close both eyes.

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.100
Now, I can't see anything.

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.800
Hmmm, can't see anything.

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800
Very, very interesting.

31
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.000
I think you need glasses.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.700
Oh, do I?

33
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.800
Yes.

34
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.500
Pedro, home time.

35
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.700
Bye bye, Pedro!

36
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.500
Bye bye!

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.900
Mummy, I need glasses.

38
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.700
What?

39
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.100
Pedro gave me an eye test
and I need glasses.

40
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.100
I'm sure youreyes are fine.

41
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.200
No, mummy,

42
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900
when I closed my eyes,

43
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.900
I couldn't see anything.

44
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.300
But no one can see anything
with theireyes closed.

45
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.500
Oh.

46
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.800
What's this about needing glasses?

47
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.500
Pedro knows all about glasses.

48
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.800
His daddy is an optician.

49
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000
All right, Peppa,

50
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.700
let's take you to the optician
for a propereye test.

51
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.800
Let's go now.

52
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.300
George, would you like
an eye test, too?

53
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.283
No.

54
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.600
Peppa is at the optician.s.

55
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.700
Mr. Pony is the optician.

56
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.400
Hello, Peppa,
please sit down.

57
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.100
Now, what can I do for you?

58
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.800
I need an eye test, please.

59
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.783
Of course, put these special glasses
on and then look at the chart.

60
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.700
Mr. Pony is going to test Peppa's eyes.

61
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.100
Can you read these letters for me, please?

62
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.083
Ok, hmmm A... B... C... D... E... F...

63
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600
Good!
Now these numbers, please.

64
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.583
Hmmm. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6

65
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.600
Very good!

66
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
And now these colors, please.

67
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.583
Red... green... orange...

68
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.400
Excellent!

69
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.700
While I check your results,

70
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.500
would you like to choose some glasses?

71
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.100
Yes, please.

72
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.500
How about these glasses, Peppa?

73
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.400
They're funny.

74
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.700
I know,
what about these ones?

75
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.500
They're too big.

76
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
How about these?

77
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.900
Wow, I like these ones, Mummy.

78
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.900
Yes, Peppa.
You look fantastic.

79
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.883
I look fantastic.

80
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.900
Good news!

81
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.100
Peppa has perfect eyesight.

82
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.900
Oh, so I don't need glasses?

83
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.800
No!

84
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.900
But I really want glasses.

85
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.883
Hmmm, I suppose you could
have some sunglasses.

86
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Yes, sunglasses.

87
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400
Here you are.

88
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.800
Fantastic!

89
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.200
I hope it's sunny every day.

90
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.183
So I can always wear my sunglasses.
