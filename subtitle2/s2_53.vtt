00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
Cold winter day

2
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000
lt. S very cold today.

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.490
Peppa and George
are wearing their hats,

4
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.991
scarves, coats, mittens and boots.

5
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.800
Look, George,
the trees haven't got leaves.

6
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.400
In the wintertime,
the trees lose their leaves.

7
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.900
Peppa and George had found
a muddy puddle.

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.300
Peppa and George love jumping
up and down in muddy puddles.

9
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.300
Me first.

10
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.291
It's so cold,
the puddle has turned to ice,

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.291
it is very slippery.

12
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
It's not funny.

13
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.800
Here are Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig.

14
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.900
Good, a muddy puddle.

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.300
Daddy Pig loves jumping
in muddy puddles.

16
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.283
Stop, Daddy.

17
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.691
That was close.

18
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.691
Lucky I've got such
a good sense of balance.

19
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.291
Daddy, the puddles are icy today,

20
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.291
we can. T jump in them.

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.400
Never mind.

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800
Let's feed some bread to the ducks.

23
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.789
Hooray!

24
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.792
Peppa and George love feeding the ducks.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.389
Hello, ducks.

26
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.800
We've got some bread foryou.

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200
The ducks like bread.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.189
It's so cold,

29
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.192
the pond has frozen to ice.

30
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.000
The ice is very slippery.

31
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.991
Sorry for laughing,
Mrs. Duck.

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.991
But it did look quite funny.

33
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.400
It is starting to snow.

34
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.383
Snow!
Peppa and George love snow.

35
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.083
George, let's catch snowflakes.

36
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.700
Peppa and George are
catching snowflakes.

37
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.900
Oh...
George has caught a snowflake.

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.883
Peppa has caught a snowflake.

39
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.300
Here is Suzy sheep
on her toboggan.

40
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.283
Hello, Peppa.
Wow. Suzy, that looks fun.

41
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.300
We are all tobogganing
on the big hill.

42
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.800
There is lots of snow there.

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.100
Shall we climb up the big hill
and watch the tobogganing?

44
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.083
Yes, please.

45
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.283
Peppa's friends are tobogganing
on the big hill.

46
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.400
Oh, dear,
George has slipped on the hill.

47
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.100
You look funny, George.

48
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.083
George does not
think it is funny.

49
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.983
It's quite easy
to slip on the hill.

50
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600
Maybe I should carry George.

51
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.100
Daddy, can you carry me too?

52
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.300
All right, Peppa.

53
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.790
Just be careful.

54
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.000
You don't slip over,
Daddy Pig.

55
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.991
Don't worry, Mummy Pig,

56
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.991
remember I've got
a excellent sense of balance.

57
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.100
Let's have a race.

58
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.083
Yes! Ready, steady, go!?
Weeeee...

59
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.100
Here we are.
The top of the big hill.

60
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.800
Do be careful,
you don't slip, daddy pig.

61
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.783
I am not going to slip, Wow...

62
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.283
Daddy is like a big toboggan.
Yo-ho...

63
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.600
We are going to win the race.
Hooray!

64
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.300
Peppa and George are the winners.

65
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.200
Well done, Peppa.

66
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.183
My daddy makes
a very good toboggan.

67
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.400
It 's not funny.

68
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.383
It is a big funny, Daddy Pig.
