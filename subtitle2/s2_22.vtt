An echo is the sound you hear
when you speak loudly in the mountains.

62
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.900

Where are the ducks?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.000
They always turn up
when we have picnics.

70
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Silly peppa.

71
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.300
Ducks don't live in the top
of the mountains.

72
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.500

76
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.200

It's time to go home.

82
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.783
Everybody has had a great time.

83
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.700
Let's all sing a song.

84
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.300
Can we have the
Bing Bong song, please?

85
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.800

and a bong and a bing.
