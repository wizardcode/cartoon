00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.300
Recycling

2
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.200
Mr. Bull the binman is collecting the rubbish.

3
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.183
It is early morning so Mr. Bull tries to
be as quiet as he can.

4
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.283
But Mr. Bull is not very good at being quiet.

5
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.500
Peppa and George are finishing their breakfast.

6
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200
What's that noise?

7
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.400
It's Mr. Bull the binman.

8
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.300
Hello, Mr. Bull.

9
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.000
Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
Must be off.

11
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700
Lots of rubbish to collect!

12
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.800
Bye!

13
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.200
Mr. Bull has emptied the rubbish bin for us.

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Good! Let's clear up the breakfast things.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
Can we help, Mummy?

16
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.400
Yes, you can!

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.300
Let's throw this empty bottle in the bin.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.600
Peppa, stop!

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
What?

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.100
We don't put bottles in the rubbish bin.

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
They can be recycled.

22
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.700
What does that mean?

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.600
All the things we can't use again,

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.500
we put in the rubbish bin for Mr. Bull.

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.483
But all the things that can be used again
are put in these recycle boxes.

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200
The red one is for newspapers.

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.600
The blue one is for tin cars

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.700
and the green one is for bottles.

29
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.900
Peppa, you have a bottle,

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.500
so which box does it go in?

31
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.800
Errm, the green one!

32
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.700
Yes!

33
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.100
This is fun!

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.500
Now, it's George's turn.

35
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.483
Can you find a newspaper forthe red box?

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.500
George wants to recycle Daddy Pig's newspaper.

37
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.300
Ho ho, I haven't finished with
my newspaper just yet, George.

38
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.500
You can have it in a minute.

39
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.000
Oh, all right!

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.800
Here you are, George!

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.783
Newspapers go in the red box, George.

42
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.100
Now that we have collected enough things,

43
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.300
we can go to the recycle center.

44
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.600
Hooray! Let's go!

45
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.000
Mummy Pig has the bottles.

46
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.500
Peppa has the tin cans

47
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.800
and George has the newspapers.

48
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.300
Is everybody ready?

49
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300
Yes, Daddy Pig!

50
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.283
Then let's go!

51
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.600
Recycle! Recycle!

52
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
We're going to recycle.

53
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.000
Tin cans!

54
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.100
Bottles!

55
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.700
Newspapers!

56
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.100
Recycle! Recycle!

57
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.083
We're going to recycle.

58
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.500
This is Miss Rabbit's recycle center.

59
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.200
We're here!

60
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.600
Hooray.

61
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.200
Hello, there!

62
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.900
Hello, Miss Rabbit.

63
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.400
Have you come to do some recycling?

64
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.700
Yes, we have.

65
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000
Jolly good!

66
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.700
Carry on!

67
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.100
What's Miss Rabbit doing?

68
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.800
She's recycling all the rusty, old cars.

69
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.200
Wow!

70
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.100
Who can tell me which bin
the bottles go in?

71
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.700
The green one!

72
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700
That. S right!

73
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.300
And the cans go in the blue one!

74
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.700
Well done! Peppa.

75
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.900
George wants to recycle the newspapers.

76
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.883
OK, George,
You can do the newspapers.

77
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.700
There!
That's enough recycling forone day.

78
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.300
Yes, let's go home.

79
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.200
Oh, where's our car gone?

80
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.000
Peppa's car has disappeared.

81
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.800
Stand back!

82
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.500
Miss Rabbit is recycling Peppa's car.

83
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.100
Stop! That's ourcar!

84
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.200
What? Ls it really?

85
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.600
Yes!

86
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.583
Ourcar isn't old and rusty!

87
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.900
Silly me, I just love recycling.

88
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.500
Yes, so do we.

89
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.400
But we also love our little car!

90
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.200
Yes, nd our little car loves us too.

91
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.183
Don't you?
