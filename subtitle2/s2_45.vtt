1
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.100
The toy cupboard

2
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.083
It is Peppa and George's bedtime.

3
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.800
Goodness me, why are
all these toys in your bed?

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800
That's where they live.

5
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Quickly, put the toys away
in yourtoy basket.

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.400
But the toy basket is full.

7
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.100
Oh, so it is,

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700
maybe you need a toy cupboard.

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
Yes, I could make one tomorrow.

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.500
The last thing you made,

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.200
daddy pig, was this shelf.

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
I am very proud of that shelf.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.300
But daddy it's all wobbly.

14
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.500
We use it as a slide.

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.800
The teddy and Mr. Dinosaur.

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700
All right, let's buy a new toy cupboard.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.000
We can buy one now on the computer.

18
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
Hooray!

19
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.400
Mummy pig is using the computer
to buy a toy cupboard.

20
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.700
Aha, now which one should we get?

21
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.200
Can we have this one, please?

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.100
That looks perfect,

23
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.300
mummy pig is buying the toy cupboard.

24
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.800
Congratulations, yourtoy
cupboard is ordered.

25
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.200
Oh, goody.

26
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.300
It is morning.

27
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.300
And the Mr. Zebra the postman
has a special delivery.

28
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.900
Post!

29
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.200
Special delivery for MS. Peppa pig
and masterGeorge.

30
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.500
What is it?

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.300
It's a toy cupboard.

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.400
Oh, It looks a bit flat.

33
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.800
Yes, you built it yourself.

34
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.900
Oh...

35
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.700
Don't worry, Peppa,

36
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.200
it'll be very easy for
your mummy and daddy to build.

37
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.500
Goodbye, bye bye, bye...

38
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.200
Now what do we do?

39
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.183
Now we build yourtoy cupboard.

40
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.900
That's strange.

41
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.500
There aren't any instructions.

42
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Maybe it's so easy to build it
doesn't need instructions.

43
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.800
Mummy, can we help?

44
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.500
Yes, first, I need a shelf.

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.100
Here is a green shelf.

46
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.400
Thank you, peppa,

47
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.600
now I need four legs.

48
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.400
One, two, three, four.

49
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.300
Four blue legs, mummy

50
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.100
Lovely, we'll have this done in no time.

51
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.800
Here is red door, mummy pig.

52
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.000
Thank you, daddy pig.

53
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.100
There, finished.

54
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.600
Well done, mummy pig.

55
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
It's very tiny.

56
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.900
How would all our toy fit inside?

57
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.400
It's a little small.

58
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
Oh, George has found another bit.

59
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.500
Oh, maybe that is a spare shelf.

60
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.300
And these would be bits too

61
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.600
Oh, dear, the cupboard is tiny,

62
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.400
because mummy pig has not
used all the pieces.

63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
We'll just have to take it apar
t and start again.

64
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.500
Oh, no.

65
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.200
If only we have the instructions.

66
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.600
Who can that be?

67
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.900
Hello, I just found these in my van.

68
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.300
It's the missing instructions.

69
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.300
That would make things a lot easier.

70
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.400
Hooray.

71
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.300
The instructions look very complicated.

72
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.700
It's no good,

73
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.000
it's nonsense.

74
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.300
Leave it to me, daddy pig.

75
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.400
I am quite enjoy
putting these things together.

76
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.500
Really?

77
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.200
Can we help it anyway?

78
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.700
You can put the kettle on.

79
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.683
I'll have a nice cup of tea
with six sugars, please

80
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.500
Everyone is preparing tea
and biscuits for Mr. Zebra.

81
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.100
Tea time, Mr. Zebra.

82
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.800
Wow...

83
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.600
Mr. Zebra has built the toy cupboard.

84
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.400
My goodness, that was quick.

85
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.383
Yeah, and I've put all your toys in there too.

86
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.000
Thank you, Mr. Zebra.

87
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.600
But there is no room for these last two.

88
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.800
Oh, poor teddy and Mr. Dinosaur.

89
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.600
Where are they going to live?

90
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.400
Why not simply orderanther easy
to make cupboard?

91
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.600
No!

92
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.700
I've got a better idea.

93
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.400
Teddy and Mr. Dinosaur
can live on your beds.

94
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400
But mummy, that is
where they lived before.

95
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.900
Yes, I know.

96
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.883
That's why it. S such a good idea.
