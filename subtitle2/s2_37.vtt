00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.400
Painting

2
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.900
Peppa and George
are painting today.

3
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.700
We need some old newspaper
to put on the table.

4
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700
Yes!

5
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.200
Daddy pig is reading
his newspaper.

6
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.183
You could have my newspape
r when I finish reading it.

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.500
All right!

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.900
Hooray!

9
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.883
Now we can start painting.

10
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.300
Silly George!

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.283
Big children do not
put their hands in the paint.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.983
George loves painting with his hands.

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.000
Peppa loves painting
with her hands.

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.800
Very good.

15
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.100
Can I have a potato, mummy pig?

16
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.200
They aren't cooked yet, daddy pig

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.100
Are you hungry, daddy?

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.600
I am not going to eat it.

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.700
Watch this!

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.683
What is daddy pig doing?

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.283
Now who can tell
me what this is.

22
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Aflower!

23
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.100
Clever daddy!

24
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.200
I loved painting
when I was a young piggy.

25
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.400
Now where are
my old painting things.

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.400
Daddy, why are you
wearing that funny hat?

27
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
This is my beret,

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.500
it puts me in the mood
for painting pictures.

29
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.483
Now what shall I paint?

30
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.800
Well chosen, George.

31
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.900
I'll paint the old cherry tree.

32
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.200
What's that?

33
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.100
It's an easel, Peppa.

34
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.700
It hold my canvas.

35
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.500
What's the canvas?

36
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.800
It's big like paper for
very special paintings.

37
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800
Is that toothpaste?

38
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.100
No, Peppa,

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.083
These are special paints
forgrown-up artist.

40
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.200
There!

41
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.800
What color should
we begin with?

42
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.100
Red, please!

43
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.400
Why red, Peppa?

44
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.100
Red is my favorite color.

45
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.800
But first we need to paint the sky.

46
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.500
Look! What color is it?

47
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.400
Blue, of course.

48
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.900
Very good.

49
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.300
Let's start with blue.

50
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.400
Now forthe cherry tree.

51
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.000
We need green for the leaves.

52
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But there isn't any green.

53
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.300
Never mind!

54
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.200
If we mix blue paint
with yellow paint,

55
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.700
we can make green.

56
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.100
Mixing blue and yellow
makes green.

57
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.500
Ohhhhhh

58
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.200
What lovely green leaves!

59
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.800
And here's some grass...

60
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.900
What about the brown branches?

61
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.200
We haven't got brown paint.

62
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.800
We can make brown.

63
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.300
We'll mix the green and the red.

64
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.300
Mixing green and red
makes brown.

65
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Daddy pig paints the tree trun
k and the branches.

66
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.600
Whah!

67
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.000
Daddy, can I paint the cherries?

68
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.100
Yes, Peppa,

69
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.083
put your fingers in the paint
and dab it onto the tree.

70
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.900
One, two, three.

71
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.000
Well done!

72
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.983
Now it's George's turn.

73
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.700
What a great painter
you are, George!

74
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.000
There, the painting is finished.

75
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Hooray!

76
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Oh, it's the ducks.

77
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.400
Hello, Mrs. Duck

78
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.300
We are painting a picture.

79
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.100
The ducks are running
through daddy's paint.

80
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.400
Shoo! Shoo!

81
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.800
Naughty ducks!

82
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.100
Shoo! Ducks! Shoo!

83
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.083
Stay away from my painting.

84
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.700
Oh, no!

85
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.700
The ducks have made paint
footprints all overthe painting.

86
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.300
Oh, dear!

87
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.000
What was all that noisy?

88
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.400
Mummy, the ducks have
spoiled our painting.

89
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.000
Mmmm, let me see.

90
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.600
The ducks are making paint footprints in the
garden just like the ones on the painting.

91
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.100
Daddy's painting isn't spoiled, Peppa.

92
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.600
It's perfect!

93
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.300
Hooray!

94
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.300
Oh, Yes.

95
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.100
I am a bit of an expert at painting.

96
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.083
And so are the ducks.
