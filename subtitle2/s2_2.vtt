Teddy's day out

2
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300
Peppa and her family are going out forthe day.

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.600
Daddy Pig has made a picnic.

4
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.100
Peppa, George, have you got yourstuff ready?

5
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.400
Yes, I'm taking teddy!

6
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.900
Dinosaur!

7
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.800
If you take yourtoys, you must look afterthem!

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.783
Yes, Mummy!

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.800
Are we all ready?

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500
Yes, Daddy Pig!

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.400
Then let's go!

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.300
Dinosaur!

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.400
George has left Mr. Dinosaur behind.

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.383
Oh George, you should
take more care of Mr. Dinosuar!

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.900
Dinosaur!

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.700
Are we all absolutely sure
we haven't forgotten anything else?

17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.200
Yes, Daddy Pig!

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800
Teddy! I've left Teddy!

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.600
Where did you leave teddy?

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.600
I think, on the kitchen table.

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.100
Peppa, you really must take more care of Teddy!

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.900
Teddy!

23
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.700
Here we go again!

24
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.500
All ready?

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.100
Yes, Daddy Pig

26
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.300
Here we go!

27
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.900
This is the picnic area.

28
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.800
We are here!

29
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.200
Hooray!

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Ah... I love this picnic spot!

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.183
It's so quiet and peaceful!

32
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.600
It is Zoey Zebra with her daddy,
Mr. Zebra the postman.

33
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.500
Hello Mr. Zebra!

34
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Have you got all post?

35
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Ho~~Ho, no delivery today!

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
It is my day off!

37
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.600
Neigh, we're having a picnic lunch.

38
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.900
So are we!

39
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.800
I know, why don't we make one big picnic?

40
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.000
Yes!

41
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800
What a splendid picnic!

42
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700
Please make George and I
leave the table and play with Zoey!

43
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.900
Yes Peppa!

44
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.400
Zoey, I've got my Teddy!

45
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.100
I've got my monkey!

46
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.800
Dinosaur!

47
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.400
I've got a toy picnic set!

48
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.900
Let's play picnics!

49
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.700
Oh, it's the ducks!

50
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.000
They always turn up when we have a picnic.

51
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We've got pretend orange juice.

52
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.983
And we've got pretend cake.

53
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.800
It's pretend cake, it's very nice

54
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.500
Oh, dear. I do not think
the ducks want pretend cake!

55
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.483
Oh, well. That means there's more for monkey,
Mr. Dinosaurand teddy!

56
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.900
Hum, delicious

57
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.700
Monkey says, the best cake ever!

58
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.100
Peppa George home time!

59
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.500
Bye-bye, Zoey

60
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.300
Bye-bye!

61
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.400
Are we all ready?

62
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.900
Yes, Daddy Pig

63
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.500
Home time for us, too, Zoey.

64
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.200
Yes, daddy!

65
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.183
Cups, plates, monkey, teddy.
Oh, no! You shouldn't be here, teddy!

66
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.900
Peppa has forgotten her teddy, again!

67
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.200
Peppa and herfamily are home.

68
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.100
That's enough driving for one day.

69
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.300
All I want to do now is relax!

70
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.300
Put my feet up and watch some...

71
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.100
Teddy!

72
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.800
I forgot Teddy!

73
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.783
Oh Peppa, now Daddy Pig will have to drive
all the way back to the picnic spot.

74
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.400
Huh... Yes of course!

75
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.800
It's Mr. Zebra, the postman

76
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.800
I thought it was your day off today, Mr. Zebra.

77
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.783
It is my day off! But Zoey's got a very
special delivery for a Miss Peppa pig.

78
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.700
Here you are, Peppa

79
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.300
What is it?

80
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.200
It's teddy!

81
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.100
You left teddy behind,

82
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.200
So we brought him home.

83
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.800
Thank you Zoey!

84
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.900
Teddy certainly has had an exciting day out.

85
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.200
But Peppa, you really must take better care of him.

86
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.500
Yes Mummy. You're a very naughty teddy!

87
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500
You must promise not to wonderoff ever again.

88
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.483
Sorry, Peppa. I promise.
