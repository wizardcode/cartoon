00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.200
Stars

2
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.189
It is almost time for bed.

3
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.192
Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and Peppa
are having mugs of hot milk.

4
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.000
George, why are you dressing up
in that spacesuit?

5
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500
You should be in your pajamas.

6
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.400
George loves everything
to do with space.

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.383
Oh, George, take your spaces helmet off
to drink your milk.

8
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.000
Bed time, little ones.

9
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.700
At night, George likes to
listen to his space mobile.

10
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.700
No space again,
it's boring.

11
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.000
Space isn't boring,
it is full of stars.

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.400
I can't see anything,
it's too dark.

13
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.500
It's easierto see
the stars from the outside.

14
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.400
Can we go outside now?

15
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.100
Peppa, you are in your pajamas.

16
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.083
Maybe if you put yourcoats on over your pajamas
we could go outside just this once.

17
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.483
Hooray!

18
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.600
Daddy, why are you lying on the ground?

19
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000
This is the best way to see the stars.

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.300
Look at these little stars,
imagine you are joining the dots.

21
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.500
That's call the Big Dipper.

22
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.483
Yes, and the two stars at the end
point to the north star.

23
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.783
Wow... north stars, north star,
are you nearor are you far?

24
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.900
Can we get that in the car...

25
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.800
No, Peppa, the star is much too far away.

26
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.500
Are they further away than the seaside?

27
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.000
Oh, yes.
But they look a lot closerthough a telescope.

28
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Have we got a telescope?

29
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.400
No, but grandpa pig has a very good telescope.

30
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.400
Can we go to grandpa pig. S house now?

31
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.800
It's much too late.

32
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.100
Maybe we can go just this once, daddy pig.

33
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.300
Hooray.

34
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.283
It's the first time Peppa and George
have been in the car at night.

35
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
Look, we are following the north star.

36
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.583
North star, north star, shining with a twinkly glow,
please show us which way to go.

37
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.200
Peppa and George has arrived in
grandpa and granny pig's house.

38
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.183
Oh, dear. I do hope grandpa and granny pig
haven. T gone to bed.

39
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.100
What are you doing here at this hour?

40
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.400
We want to see the stars.

41
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.000
Peppa and George were hoping
they can look though yourtelescope.

42
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.983

43
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.900

44
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.883
Wow... grandpa pig hobby is looking at the stars.

45
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.500
Now who's forthe first look?

46
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.400
Me, me, me...

47
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.700
OH, the north star.

48
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.200
We sailor uses it to find our way home.

49
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.183
Daddy used it to find his way here.

50
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.700
Are there otherthings in the sky?

51
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.683
Yes, this is the planet call Saturn.

52
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.900
What are those pretty rings?

53
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.500
They are made of block and ice.

54
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.800
Saturn is very very cold.

55
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.783
We can build a snowman, George.

56
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.183
Quick, look. Oh... it's a shooting star.

57
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.400
You must make a wish.

58
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.383
I wish that when George is old enough to
have his own rocket he will take me into space.
