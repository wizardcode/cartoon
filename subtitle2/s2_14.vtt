00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.500
Pirate Island

2
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.900
Grandpa pig is taking peppa and his friends
for a day out on his boat.

3
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
Everyone on board.

4
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.700
Aye aye, captain grandpa.

5
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.500
Full sail

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.087
See you later.

7
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.600
Peppa and her friends
are all wearing life jackets.

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.583
George, you could wear my pirate hat.

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.983
Today, we are sailing to pirate island.

10
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
If we are lucky,

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.300
we might find buried treasure.

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.800
Wow!

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.400
Pirate Island sounds like a great place.

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.383
Land, ahoy.

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.100
Here we are, Pirate Island.

16
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
Hooray!

17
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.200
What's that?

18
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.100
It's a metal detector.

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.083
It finds buried treasure.

20
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.200
Grandpa pig is using the metal detector
to find buried treasure.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.700
Ah!

22
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.900
The metal detective have found something.

23
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.500
That's digged dot.

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.300
It's a metal coin.

25
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.000
Treasure! Hooray!

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.900
Let's find some more.

27
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.800
Ah, we found something else.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.783
It sounds big!

29
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.900
My goodness!

30
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.800
This big treasure is quite heavy.

31
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.500
Ho, dear.

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.600
That's not a metal treasure.

33
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.000
It's a rusty shopping trolley.

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400
Maybe it enough treasure hunting.

35
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.800
Who wants to help me
to build a big sandcastle?

36
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.900
Me! Me!

37
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
What a good idea, granny pig

38
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.500
Now I just check on the boat.

39
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Granny pig is going to help children
build a big sandcastle.

40
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.200
And grandpa pig is doing
his important old things.

41
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.700
Ha, this is nice.

42
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.683
Maybe I just close my eyes
for a little bit.

43
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.900
Granny pig and children
are making a big sandcastle.

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.900
They need lots and lots sands.

45
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.883
They use buckets to
make the castle's turrets.

46
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.400
What a splendid castle.

47
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.800
Hooray!

48
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.500
Time to go home.

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.200
Oh, where has the boat gone?

50
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.600
Look, granny.

51
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.900
Oh, no,

52
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.500
grandpa pig is fast asleep
and the boat is drifting away.

53
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
We have to wake grandpa up.

54
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.600
Shout as loudly you can.

55
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.400
Grandpa pig!

56
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.900
Wake up! Wake up!

57
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.100
Oh, no, grandpa pig is still asleep.

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.000
Grandpa's too far away to hear us.

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.600
We're stuck on Pirate Island.

60
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.700
We castaways.

61
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.100
We'll be here fora hundreds years.

62
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.500
We'll have to eat wild fruit and berries.

63
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.483
And we'll have to eat insects and slugs.

64
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.500
Errr...

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.483
The parents are here
to collect the children.

66
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.500
Where am I?

67
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.300
Hello.

68
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.800
Hello, everyone.

69
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.600
Have you had a nice time?

70
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.900
Yes, actually,

71
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.700
I've just left something behind.

72
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.500
Back in a tick.

73
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.900
Look, that's grandpa.

74
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.300
We're safed.

75
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.900
Hooray!

76
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.600
Welcome aboard me hearties.

77
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.000
Naughty grandpa pig,

78
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
we thought you left us behind

79
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200
Sorry about it, granny pig.

80
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.183
Next time I promise not to fall asleep.

81
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200
Good bye, Pirate Island.

82
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.100
See you again soon.

83
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.200
I love Pirate Island.

84
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.500
Can we visit it again?

85
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.700
Of course we can, peppa.

86
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.683
Hooray!
