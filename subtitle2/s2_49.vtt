00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.883
Bouncy ball

2
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.600
Peppa and George are going to play
in the garden with their ball.

3
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.583
Wee... George throws the ball as high as
he can and catches it.

4
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.583
I can do that too.
Wee...

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.700
Oh, Peppa has missed the ball.

6
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.800
This is a silly game.

7
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.100
Here is Peppa's best friend Suzy sheep.

8
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Suzy has two tennis racquets.

9
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.400
Hello, Peppa. Hello, Suzy.
Let's play tennis.

10
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.383
Yes, that sounds fun.
To you, Suzy.

11
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.083
Oh, Suzy has missed the ball.

12
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.683
Oh, Peppa has missed the ball.

13
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.083
Peppa and Suzy like playing tennis.
But George feels a bit left out.

14
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.583
Oh, sorry, George, you can't play tennis,
we only have two racquets.

15
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.200
I know,
George can be the ball boy.

16
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
Yes, it is a very important job.

17
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.183
George is going to be the ball boy. He has
to collect the ball when it is hit too far.

18
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.200
To you, Suzy.
Oh, Missed it.

19
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.183
Ball boy...

20
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.500
Thank you, ball boy.

21
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.483
Oh, Ball boy...

22
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.400
Thank you, ball boy.

23
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.700
Ball boy...

24
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.683
Oh, dear,
George doesn't like this game.

25
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.700
Here are Danny dog, Pedro pony, Candy cat,
Rebecca rabbit and Richard ribbit.

26
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.000
Hello, everyone. Hello.

27
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.700
We are playing tennis.

28
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.300
Can we play too?

29
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.500
But there aren't enough racquets.

30
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.000
Oh, Let's play something else.

31
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Let's play football.
Yes, football.

32
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.200
Girls against boys.

33
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
We each need a goalkeeper.

34
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.300
Me... me... me... me...

35
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.800
Pedro pony and Rebecca rabbit
will be the goalkeepers.

36
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.783
We'll start.

37
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.800
Goal...

38
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.000
Rebecca rabbit has scored a goal.

39
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.300
The boy is winning.

40
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.100
That's not fair.

41
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.600
We weren't ready.

42
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.300
Hi, that's cheating.
You can't hold the ball.

43
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.200
Yes, I can.
I am the goalkeeper.

44
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.183
Go, Rebecca, go. Goal.
Hooray!

45
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.500
The goal is not allowed.

46
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.600
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

47
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.900
What a lot of noise!

48
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.100
Daddy, the boys are cheating.

49
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.200
No, the girls are cheating.

50
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.500
It's sounds like
you need a referee.

51
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500
What's a referee?

52
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.600
It's someone who make sure
that everyone plays fair.

53
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.500
I'll be the referee.
Me... me... me...

54
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000
Stop! Stop!
I'll be the referee.

55
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.300
The next team to get a goal
will win the game.

56
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.300
Hooray!

57
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.200
Where's the ball?

58
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.400
Quick! Score a goal.

59
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.383
Stop them.

60
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.400
Goal!
Richard rabbit has scored a goal.

61
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.900
Hooray!

62
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.600
The boys win.

63
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.200
Oh, football is a silly game.

64
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.100
Just a moment,
the boys scored in their own goal.

65
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.300
That means the girls win.

66
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.283
Really? Hooray.
Football is a great game.
