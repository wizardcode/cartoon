00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.790
Mr Scarecrow

2
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.783
Peppa and George are playing at Grandpa
and Granny Pig's house today.

3
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.100
Hello, Grandpa Pig!

4
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.400
Baba lg!

5
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.800
Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.

6
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Grandpa, What are you doing?

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.600
I'm making a flower garden.

8
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000
Ooooh.

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
These seeds will grow into beautiful flowers.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.300
I drop the seeds on the ground.

11
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.600
Then I cover the seeds with earth.

12
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Oh! Where have they gone?

13
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
The seeds have disappeared.

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.700
That's strange.

15
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm sure I put some seeds here.

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.200
Yes, Grandpa.
We saw you.

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.400
Well, they're not here now.

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.100
Oh, well.

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.800
I. II just have to use some more.

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200
As I was saying,

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.183
I simply drop the seeds on the ground.

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.900
A little bird is eating
Grandpa Pig's flowerseeds.

23
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.500
Get off my seeds!

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100
So that's where all my seeds went.

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.100
Into the little bird's tummy!

26
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.500
Two more little birds are eating
Grandpa Pig. S seeds.

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.800
Oh! Look!

28
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.700
Ah! Shoo! Shoo!

29
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.600
What's all this noise?

30
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.700
Granny Pig, the birds are eating
all my flowerseeds.

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.200
So we're chasing the birds away!

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.700
There. S no point chasing them.

33
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.000
They'll just come back again.

34
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.300
Look! We need a scarecrow.

35
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.900
What's a scarecrow?

36
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.200
A scarecrow is a strawman
that scares birds away.

37
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.100
What a good idea, Granny Pig!

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.600
I'll make one!

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.100
Come on, everyone.

40
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.100
Bye bye, Little birds!

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.900
We're going to make a scarecrow.

42
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.600
This is Grandpa pig's garden shed.

43
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.200
There'll be plenty of things in here
to make a scarecrow.

44
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.300
First, we need two sticks
and some strings.

45
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.700
We'll find them.

46
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.600
Peppa has found some sticks.

47
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.500
George has found some string.

48
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.187
Good! I'll tie the sticks together
to make the body.

49
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.389
Granny Pig has found some straw and an old sack.

50
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.289
Lovely! I'll put the straw in the sack
to make the head.

51
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.800
Now, the scarecrow
needs something to wear.

52
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.200
Here's a bag of old clothes.

53
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.900
Oooh!

54
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.100
George has found a dress.

55
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.600
Silly George!

56
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.500
Mr. Scarecrow doesn't
want to wear a dress.

57
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.100
Peppa has found a coat.

58
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.300
Very good! Peppa.

59
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.200
George has found a hat.

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.400
Very good! George.

61
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.100
Mr. Scarecrow needs a face.

62
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.600
That. S right.

63
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.200
Would you and George
like to paint a face?

64
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.000
Yes, please.

65
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.400
George paints the eyes and nose.

66
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.700
Peppa paints the mouth.

67
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.400
Fantastic!

68
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.900
Mr, Scarecrow is ready.

69
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.200
Hooray!

70
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.400
The little birds are looking for
Grandpa's flowerseeds.

71
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.000
Look! The little birds are back.

72
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.300
Don't worry, Peppa.

73
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.283
Mr. Scarecrow will scare them off.

74
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.400
It worked.

75
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.000
Mr. Scarecrow has scared
the little birds away.

76
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.700
Hooray!

77
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.683
Good! Now,
my flower seeds will not be eaten.

78
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.600
Oh, Grandpa,
the bird look very sad.

79
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.200
Yes, they must be hungry.

80
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.300
That's why I've brought this.

81
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.800
What. S that, Granny?

82
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.700
It's a birdfeeder.

83
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.683
Grandpa,
may I have some seeds, please?

84
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.300
Come on, birdies! Lunchtime!

85
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.900
Now, the birds have their own seeds to eat.

86
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.500
Hooray! The little birds are happy again!

87
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.200
Peppa is glad that Grandpa's seeds
will not be eaten.

88
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.183
But she is even more glad that
the little birds will not be hungry.
