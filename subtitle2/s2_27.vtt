00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
Foggy Day

2
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.600
Peppa and George are
going to the playground today.

3
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.200
Should we drive to the playgroud?

4
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.700
No, let's walk.

5
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.300
Look, it's just over there.

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500
The playgroud is quite close.

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.400
OK, let's walk.

8
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
This way, everyone.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.690
We're going to the playground.

10
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.500
Oh, where has the sky gone?

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
Don't worry, Peppa.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
It's just fog.

13
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.100
What's fog?

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.400
Fog is a cloud that is on the ground
instead of in the sky.

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.900
Oooh.

16
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.100
Hmm, it. S very thick fog.

17
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100
I can't see a thing.

18
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.000
Hmmm, maybe we should
go back home.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.100
Yes, we'll go to the
playground anotherday.

20
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.500
Ohh...

21
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.800
It is too foggy to
find the playground.

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.400
So Peppa and George
have to go back home.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.300
Now, which way is home?

24
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Are we lost, Daddy Pig?

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.200
Don't worry.

26
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.900
I know exactly
where we are.

27
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.400
This way.

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.900
Oh, who put that tree there?

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.100
Daddy pig has
walked into a tree.

30
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.700
Are you OK, Daddy pig?

31
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.100
Yes, I'm fine.

32
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.500
This way.

33
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.400
Daddy pig, do you know
where you're going?

34
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.000
Yes, of course I do.

35
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.800
I don't think we'll ever
find our house again.

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.300
I'm sure we will, Peppa.

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.100
We're only in ourgarden.

38
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
Oh, it's the ducks.

39
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100
Hello, Mrs. Duck!

40
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.800
Have you lost your pond?

41
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.400
We're lost too.

42
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.000
We are not lost.

43
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.600
I know exactly where we are.

44
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.000
See you later, Ducks.

45
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.700
Good luck finding your pond.

46
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.700
Oh

47
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.900
Oh.

48
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.700
Daddy Pig has found the duck pond.

49
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.900
That's lucky.

50
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.600
Yes, what a stroke of luck.

51
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.400
Daddy, Mrs. Duck says thank you.

52
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.383
You're most welcome, Mrs. Duck.

53
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.400
Now, lets find our house.

54
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.200
I'm sure it's this way.

55
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.100
Hello.

56
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.500
Did you hearsomething?

57
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.400
Yes, I thought
I heard someone say.

58
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.700
Hello, it's Mummy Rabbit
with Rebecca and Richard.

59
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.400
Hello, Peppa,
we're lost.

60
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.700
Hello, Rebecca,
we're lost too.

61
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.000
We wanted to
go to the playground.

62
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.400
So did we,

63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.100
but it's too foggy to get there.

64
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.500
Come on, everyone.

65
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.200
Back to our house
until the fog clears.

66
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.000
Daddy Pig, do you know
where you're doing?

67
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.600
Yes, of course I do,

68
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600
this way.

69
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.400
Yes, Daddy Pig.

70
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.800
Ah, ha.

71
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.900
I've found our little hill.

72
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.200
We'll soon be home.

73
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.500
Hooray.

74
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.100
Our house should be
just about here.

75
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.100
Oh.

76
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.300
Daddy Pig has found a ladder.

77
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.800
That's strange.

78
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.300
We don't have a ladder
in ourgarden.

79
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.600
Goodness me!

80
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.800
Can you see
where we are Daddy Pig?

81
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.900
Yes, I can.

82
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.500
Dad, Where are we?

83
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.300
Why don't you have a look?

84
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.500
Wow, wow.

85
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.700
I can see everything again.

86
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.300
The fog is going away.

87
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.300
We're at the playground.

88
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.600
Hooray!

89
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.583
We're at the playground.

90
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.700
Seesaw, seesaw.

91
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.200
Daddy, Mummy,

92
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.100
we're at the playground.

93
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.700
Well, that's lucky.

94
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.100
But I thought we were
trying to get home.

95
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.500
So did I!

96
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.483
Maybe we did get
a bit lost after all.
