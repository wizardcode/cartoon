George catches a cold

2
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.783
Today, it is raining a little bit.

3
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.400
Peppa, George,
Put your rain clothes on.

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.383
With rains, Peppa and George must
wear their rain clothes.

5
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
George does not like
wearing his rain hat.

6
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800
George, you must keep your hat on.

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.100
Why?

8
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.000
Because you must keep dry.

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.900
Why?

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.500
Because you might catch a cold.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Why?

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.400
George, do you want to
play in the garden?

13
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600
Then keep your hat on.

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.400
Come on, George.

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.383
Peppa and George are going to
jump in muddy puddles.

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.100
Yak

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.083
George does not want to
wear his rain hat.

18
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.583
Peppa, George, come inside.
The rain is too heavy to play out.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.400
Oh, George,
where is your hat?

20
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.600
George has caught a cold.

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600
Oh, poor little george!

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.900
You don't sound well.

23
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.883
Don't worry.
I'll ring Doctor. Brown Bear.

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.700
Doctor Brown Bear speaking.

25
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.500
I see. Put George to bed
and I'll be straight round.

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
Thank you Doctor Brown Bear,
Good bye.

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.600
Would george be taken to hospital
and given medicine?

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.300
No, George just has to go to bed.

29
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.283
Oh, so George is not
really properly ill.

30
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.500
That. S disgusting!

31
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.483
Poor George,
Let's give you straight to bed.

32
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.800
George, you have to
stay in bed for a bit.

33
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.300
No.

34
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.100
George does not
want to stay in bed.

35
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.300
George, you have to stay in bed
until you are better.

36
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.500
Why?

37
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.700
Because you have to keep warm.

38
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.900
Why?

39
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.100
Uhh...
because Doctor Brown bearsaid so.

40
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.700
Hello! Where is my patient?

41
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.600
Open wide and say Ah...

42
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.000
George is a little bit worried.

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.983
En, Peppa, you are big and brave,
can you show George how to say Ah...

44
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.600
Of cause. Ah...

45
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500
Ah...

46
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.800
George has caught a cold.

47
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.700
Does George need medicine?

48
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.683
No, but he can have some nice warm milk
get to bedtime to help him to sleep.

49
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.100
Thank you Doctor Brown Bear.

50
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.083
You are welcome. Good bye!

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.500
George has been in bed all day.

52
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.900
Now it is Peppa's bedtime.

53
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.100
George, are you better?

54
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.800
George is not better.

55
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.783
George, please don't sneeze
so loudly.

56
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.700
This is impossible.

57
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.683
George. It's a nice warm milk
to help you sleep.

58
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.500
The warm milk makes George
feel very very sleepy.

59
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.200
Good night, my little piggies.

60
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.183
It's so nice in quiet.

61
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.300
It's morning.

62
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.283
George has slept very well.

63
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.000
George is better.

64
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.400
Come on everyone!
It's a lovely sunny day!

65
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.800
George is wearing his rain hat.

66
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.000
He doesn't want to
catch anothercold.

67
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Oh, George,
you don't need to wear your hat.

68
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Why?

69
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Because it's hot and sunny!

70
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Why?

71
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.900
George, can you stop saying why
all the time?

72
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.300
Why?

73
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.283
George certainly is better.
