Daddy Pig's office

2
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.900
Today, as a special treat.

3
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
Peppa and George are
visiting Daddy Pig's office.

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.400
Daddy, what do you do
at your office all day?

5
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.500
Lots of fun things.

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.100
You'll see.

7
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.200
This is the building
where Daddy Pig works.

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.900
We are here.

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.000
Hooray!

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.600
Yes?

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.700
Hello.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100
It's Daddy Pig.

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.000
Hello, Daddy Pig.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.800
Can I press the button too?

15
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.200
Of course, Peppa.

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.400
Yes?

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.900
It's me.

18
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.900
Hello me.

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.600
Come in.

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.100
My office is on the top floor.

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.200
We have to go up in the lift.

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.800
Can I press the button?

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.000
I think it's George's turn.

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.983
Press the top button, George.

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.600
The lift is taking Peppa,

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.300
George and Daddy Pig
up to the very top floor.

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.400
Wow...

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.383
Top floor, door is opening.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.400
This is Daddy Pig's office.

30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.600
Hello, everyone.

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Hello, Daddy Pig.

32
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.500
Mr. Rabbit and Ms. Cat
work with Daddy Pig.

33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.200
I brought two very special visitors
with me today.

34
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.500
Peppa and George.

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.900
What an honor.

36
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
Let's begin the tour.

37
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.500
Mr. Rabbit, can we start at your desk?

38
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
We certainly can.

39
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.900
My job is all about numbers.

40
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.200
I take a very important piece of paper.

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.600
I take a rubberstamp,

42
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
and I stamp the paper.

43
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.000
Wow.

44
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.800
What a great job MR. Rabbit has.

45
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.300
Can I do some stamping?

46
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300
Of course.

47
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600
I just find you some paper.

48
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.000
Here are some paper.

49
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.900
Maybe we should use some blank paper.

50
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.600
Here you are.

51
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.000
Peppa likes stamping with rubber stamps.

52
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.983
I like doing MR. Rabbit's job.

53
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.600
On with the tour.

54
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.400
Next up is Mrs. Cat's desk.

55
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.700
Hello, Peppa and George.

56
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.600
Hello.

57
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.583
My job is all about drawing shapes
on the computer.

58
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.983
Then I print the shapes out.

59
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.000
And here's another copy.

60
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.900
Thank you.

61
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.200
What a nice job MS. Cat has!

62
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600
Can I have a go?

63
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.900
Maybe it's George's turn now.

64
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.500
That's right, George.

65
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.400
It's your turn to do some work.

66
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.200
George is making blue triangles.

67
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.183
Now you print them out.

68
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.700
I like doing Ms. Cat's job.

69
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.000
Do you want to see my desk now?

70
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.700
Yes, please.

71
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.800
This is Daddy Pig's desk.

72
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.100
My job is quite complicated.

73
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.700
I take big numbers,

74
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.100
transmit them and calculate
their load bearing tangents.

75
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.300
Daddy Pig's job sounds very important.

76
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.600
Do you use rubber stamps?

77
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.400
No.

78
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.300
Do you use a computer?

79
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.400
No.

80
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.900
But I do use coloring pen.

81
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.900
Daddy, can we draw
with yourcoloring pens?

82
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.800
Good idea.

83
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.400
Peppa and George love drawing
with coloring pens.

84
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.600
I am drawing a house.

85
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.100
George is drawing a dinosaur.

86
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.400
George always draws dinosaurs.

87
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.383
Dinosaur!

88
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.100
My goodness, five o'clock already.

89
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.300
It is home time.

90
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.500
I say!

91
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.600
What a splendid picture of a house.

92
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.300
And what a fierce dinosaur.

93
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.500
George and I have been doing Daddy's job.

94
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.300
And they've been doing it very well.

95
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.283
I like doing MR. Rabbit's job
and I like doing Ms. Cat's job.

96
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.783
But I like doing daddy's job the best.
