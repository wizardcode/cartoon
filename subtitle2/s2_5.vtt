00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.900
George's Friend

2
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.700
Peppa and her friends are at the playground.

3
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.000
Peppa, Suzy, and Danny are on the round about.

4
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.300
Are you all ready?

5
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Ready!

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.500
Then let's go!

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.700
Whee!

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.683
Faster! Faster!

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.100
George is a bit too little for the round about.

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.083
He is playing on the swing.

11
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.800
Here's Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother,
Richard Rabbit.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.900
Hello everyone!

13
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.800
Hello!

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.400
Can I come on the round about, too?

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
Hop on, Rebecca.

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.500
Let's go really really fast.

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.800
Richard Rabbit wants to
go on the round about, too.

18
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.783
Oh, if Richard gets on,
it means we can't go fast.

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.400
Richard can play with George.

20
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.500
Richard,
would you like to play with George?

21
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.900
No.

22
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.883
George's dinosaur's just like yours.
Let's go and see.

23
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.900
Richard Rabbit is the same age as George.

24
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.100
Richard wants to see George's dinosaur.

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.300
Grrr... dinosaur.

26
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.700
George,
can Richard play with your dinosaur?

27
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.100
No.

28
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.300
Richard, can George play with yourdinosaur?

29
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.700
No.

30
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.300
George and Richard do not want to
share their dinosaurs.

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.283
George,
it'll be much more fun if you share.

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.800
That was really nice of George.

33
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.900
Dinosaur.

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.700
George does not like sharing.

35
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.683
Richard,
let George hold the dinosaurs now.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.700
Richard does nor like sharing, either.

37
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.100
What's all this crying about?

38
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
George and Richard always cry
when they play together.

39
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.200
They are just too little to play properly.

40
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.900
Can you two big girls
teach them to play together?

41
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.600
Of course we can help them
make sand castles.

42
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.583
Good idea!
Let's go to the sand pit!

43
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.600
George and Richard love the sand pit!

44
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.583
George, Richard, today we are
going to make sand castles.

45
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.583
First, we fill the buckets with sand.

46
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.083
We turn the buckets over
and give them a little tap.

47
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.400
Now we lift the buckets.

48
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.200
Hey presto!

49
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.100
Richard has made a sand castle.

50
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.600
Hey presto!

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.583
And George has made a sand castle.

52
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.983
You see, playing together is fun.

53
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.600
Oh dear!
This game has not gone very well.

54
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.583
It was your brother's fault.
He broke George's sand castle.

55
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.100
Squeak! Your brother,
broke my brother's sand castle first.

56
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.691
Now, Now,

57
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.084
you two big girls are meant to be teaching
Richard and George to play nicely together.

58
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.200
That. S right.

59
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.400
We are big girls.

60
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.600
And George and Richard are too little
to play together properly.

61
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.200
Humm, I've got an idea.

62
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.100
George, what's your most favorite thing
in the whole playground?

63
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.500
Seesaw!

64
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.483
George loves the seesaw.

65
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.800
Seesaw.

66
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.783
It is a bit difficult to
play on the seesaw on yourown.

67
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.000
Richard wants to play on the seesaw.

68
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.600
Seesaw.

69
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.900
Look!
George and Richard are playing together!

70
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.883
Seesaw.

71
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.600
George likes Richard.

72
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.800
Richard likes George.

73
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.100
George and Richard like playing together.

74
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.083
Seesaw.
