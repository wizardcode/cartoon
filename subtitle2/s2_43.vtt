00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.200
Rebecca rabbit

2
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000
It's the end of another lovely day.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.600
Peppa and George are playing with their
friends- Rebecca and Richard rabbit.

4
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.200
Home time! My little bunnies!

5
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.300
But we want to play
some more, mummy.

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.600
Maybe tomorrow.

7
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.200
Can George and Peppa come to
our house tomorrow?

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.183
Yes! Hooray!

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Why is Richard crying?

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.700
He has a bit scared of
going down stairs.

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.700
Why?

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.000
We don't have stairs in our home.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.800
What?

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.100
No stairs?

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.700
That's right, you'll see tomorrow.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.500
Bye bye.

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.483
Bye bye!

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
It is morning.

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.100
Peppa and George are going to
Rebecca rabbit's house today.

20
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.700
Mummy pig can drive,

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.300
and I'll do the map reading.

22
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.900
Are you sure, daddy pig?

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.500
We always get lost
when you do the map reading.

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.100
We won't get lost.

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.400
Okay, is everybody ready?

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.800
Yes, mummy pig.

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.300
Then let's go.

28
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.600
Peppa and George are very excited.

29
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.800
They have never been
Rebecca rabbit's house before.

30
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.000
Daddy, are we nearly there?

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.983
The map says, Rebecca's
house is on the next hill.

32
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.900
I don't understand.

33
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.300
There should be
where Rebecca rabbit lives

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.700
We must be lost,

35
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.100
that's just a garden of carrots.

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.800
Where can Rebecca's house be?

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.100
Hello, everyone.

38
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.200
Rebecca.

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.600
Do you want to play in my bedroom?

40
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.900
Your bedroom?

41
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.600
But where is your house?

42
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.200
Peppa can not see
Rebecca's house anywhere.

43
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.100
This hill is our house.

44
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.900
It's cool the burrow.

45
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.700
I'll show you.

46
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
See you later.

47
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.200
Come in.

48
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.000
We don't have stairs.

49
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.300
We have tunnels.

50
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.100
Rebecca's house is
a bit different to Peppa's.

51
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.800
This is our bedroom.

52
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.783
You have a bed and a window
and a toy box just like us.

53
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.100
Of course.

54
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.900
I like your house.

55
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900
I wish I was a rabbit.

56
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.900
I know.

57
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.700
Should I teach you both
how to be a rabbit?

58
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.900
Yes, please.

59
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.883
First, you have to twitch
your nose and squeak, like this.

60
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.183
Squeak, Squeak

61
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.600
Very good,

62
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600
Peppa rabbit and George rabbit.

63
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
Peppa likes being a rabbit.

64
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.400
George likes being a rabbit.

65
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.900
Rabbits like carrots.

66
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.800
Delicious!

67
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.100
Hmmm, Delicious!

68
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.100
Yuk!

69
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.400
George does not like carrots.

70
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
He won't even try them.

71
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.900
Oh well, more for us then.

72
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
Rebecca, what else do rabbits like?

73
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.800
Rabbits like hopping.

74
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.783
Come outside, I'll show you.

75
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.700
Let's hop!

76
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.200
Rabbits like hopping.

77
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.400
You are very good rabbits.

78
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.383
Lunch time, children.

79
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.800
Mummy and daddy rabbits
have prepared lunch.

80
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.783
Rebecca has taught us
how to be rabbits.

81
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.100
You'll enjoy lunch then,

82
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.700
it's ourfavorite carrots.

83
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.100
Delicious!

84
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.800
Delicious! Delicious! Yuk!

85
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.800
George will not eat carrots.

86
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.100
Oh, dear George,

87
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.200
I thought you were a rabbit.

88
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.000
A rabbit loves carrots.

89
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.700
Hmmmm.

90
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.400
Wow! George is eating carrot.

91
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.800
This is ourfavorite cake,
carrot cake.

92
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.900
Hooray!

93
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.200
Carrot cake.

94
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.183
George is a proper rabbit now.
