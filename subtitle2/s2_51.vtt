Daddy Pig's birthday

2
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.700
Today is Daddy Pig's birthday.
Daddy Pig has to go to work.

3
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.400
Daddy, I wish you don't have to
work on your birthday.

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.800
So do I, but I'll be home
as soon as I can.

5
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.800
See you later.
See you later.

6
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.783
While Daddy Pig is at work,
we can get all his birthday surprises ready.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.400
First, we'll make
daddy's birthday cake.

8
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.383
We start with butterand sugar and flour,
then we add an egg,

9
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.000
and most important of all,
the chocolate pieces.

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.400
Mummy Pig is making a chocolate cake.
Daddy Pig loves chocolate cake.

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.500
I give it a stir.

12
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.900
Mummy, may I stir?
Yes, Peppa.

13
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.883
Peppa loves stirring,
George wants to go.

14
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.100
Okay, George,
that's enough stirring.

15
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.200
There,
Daddy Pig's chocolate cake.

16
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700
Hooray!

17
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.200
Now we just have to
bake it in the oven.

18
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.500
Mummy, can I lick the spoon?

19
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.400
Yes, you can lick the spoon
and George can lick the bowl.

20
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.300
Yippee.

21
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.900
Peppa and George love
chocolate cake mixture.

22
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.400
Poor Daddy Pig,
he's missing all the fun.

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.100
Mummy, can I ring daddy work
and say happy birthday?

24
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.083
That's a nice idea.

25
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.700
This is the office
where Daddy Pig works.

26
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300
Hello, Mr. Rabbit speaking.

27
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.000
May I speak to Daddy Pig, please.

28
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.900
Someone foryou, Daddy Pig.
It sounds important.

29
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.000

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100
That's just one more thing to do
before daddy gets home.

37
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.300
Yes, Daddy Pig's birthday surprise.

38
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.200
Shhhh... George, remember,
it is a secret.

39
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.800
Shhhh...

40
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.783
Peppa and George have buckets of water,
Mummy Pig has balloons.

41

Thank you, everyone.
Wow, what a lot of candles.

46
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.483
That's because you are
very very old, daddy.

47
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.100
You must blow out
all yourcandles in one go.

48
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.083
I'll do my best.

49
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.800
