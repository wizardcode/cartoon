00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.100
The dentist

2
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.083
Every morning peppa and George
brush their teeth.

3
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.500
Today peppa and George
are going to the dentist.

4
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.900
Peppa, George,

5
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
are you ready to
go for your check up?

6
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.200
I am too busy for a check up,

7
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
I am having a tea party with teddy.

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.500
Yes, we are very busy.

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.500
We all need check-ups to make sure
our teeth are clean and healthy.

10
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Okay, daddy.

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.700
George, are yourteeth clean like mine?

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000
It is George's first visit to the dentist.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200
You both have lovely clean teeth,

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.183
I am sure the dentist
will be very happy.

15
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
Peppa and George are at the dentist's
waiting fortheir check-up.

16
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.700
Aa, waiting is boring.

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.400
This magazine's very interesting.

18
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.383
It's all about potatoes.

19
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.400
Peppa, George,

20
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.300
the dentist will see you now.

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300
Hooray!

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.100
This is Dr. Elephant, the dentist.

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.300
Hello, Peppa,

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.900
have you been brushing yourteeth?

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600
Yes, Dr. Elephant.

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Good.

27
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.900
Now, who's first?

28
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.200
I am first, because I am a big girl.

29
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.000
Watch me, George.

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.400
Sitting in the chair, please.

31
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.000
Hold tight.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.800
Whee...

33
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.400
Open wide, please.

34
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.700
Ah...

35
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700
wider, please.

36
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.200
Ah...

37
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600
now let's take a look

38
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.100
Dr. Elephant uses a little mirror
to look at Peppa's teeth.

39
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.083
I hope you haven't been eating
too many sweeties, Peppa.

40
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.983
It is quite difficult to speak
when your mouth is wide open.

41
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.700
There, all done.

42
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.000
What lovely clean teeth!

43
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.800
She takes after me.

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.600
Can I have this special pink drink now?

45
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.100
Yes, but don't drink, Peppa,

46
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.083
spit it out.

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.000
George, now it's your turn.

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.100
No.

49
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.200
George does not want it to be his turn.

50
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.183
Maybe you can hold Mr. Dinosaur
while the dentist looks at yourteeth.

51
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.600
Gerr... Dinosaur.

52
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.300
Very please to meet you, Mr. Dinosaur.

53
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.400
It is not a real dinosaur,

54
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.800
it's made of plastics.

55
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.500
Hold tight.

56
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.700
You're doing very well, George.

57
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.900
Now can you show me yourteeth?

58
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.600
George does not want to
show the dentist his teeth.

59
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.700
George,

60
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.500
open wide, like this.

61
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.000
Ah... ah...

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.200
Aaaaah...

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.800
Ah, there they are,

64
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.100
all done.

65
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.500
You have very strong clean teeth, George.

66
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Are they as lovely as mine, Dr. Elephant?

67
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.800
Ah...

68
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.600
Yes.

69
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600
George is very proud to have clean teeth.

70
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.583
George, don't forget the pink drink.

71
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.100
Oh, wait, what's this?

72
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.800
What's wrong, Dr Elephant?

73
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.100
George has clean teeth,

74
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.000
but this young dinosaur's
teeth are very dirty.

75
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.100
Oh, no.

76
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.500
Dr. Elephant is very cross
with Mr. Dinosaur.

77
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.700
Not at all, Peppa.

78
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300
It's my job to make teeth clean.

79
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.900
The water jet please, Ms. Rabbit.

80
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.200
The dentist uses waterto
clean Mr. Dinosaur's teeth.

81
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.000
The polisher, please, Ms Rabbit.

82
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.300
This would be a bit noisy.

83
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.200
Dr. Elephant polishes
Mr. Dinosaur's teeth.

84
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.600
Pink, pink...

85
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.000
That's righ, George.

86
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.983
Mr. Dinosaur needs
some special pink drink.

87
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.100
Gosh,

88
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.900
what shining teeth
you have, Mr. Dinosaur.

89
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.900
Err.

90
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.800
Dinosaur.

91
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.200
Too scary.

92
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
George loves Mr. Dinosaur,

93
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.183
especially now he
has nice clean teeth.
