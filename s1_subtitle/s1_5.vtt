00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.761
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

4
00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.278
Hide and Seek

5
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.226
Peppa and George are playing

6
00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:31.955
hide and seek.

7
00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.295
It is George's turn to hide.

8
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.595
He must quickly find
somewhere to hide

9
00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.164
before Peppa finishes counting!

10
00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:42.040
One... two... three...

11
00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:48.876
four... five... six... seven...

12
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.039
George has found somewhere to hide,
eight...

13
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.046
just in time!
nine...

14
00:00:52.317 --> 00:00:53.113
ten...

15
00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.250
Ready or not.
here I come!

16
00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.813
Peppa has to find
Where George is hiding.

17
00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:03.185
Found you!

18
00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.190
Peppa has found George.

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.627
George, I could see you too easily.

20
00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:11.760
Now it is Peppa's turn to hide.

21
00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.072
One... erm... three.

22
00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:17.200
I'll help George to count.

23
00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:27.645
One... two... three...
four... five...

24
00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:37.358
six... seven... eight...
nine... ten!

25
00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.655
Okay, George, open your eyes!

26
00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.966
George has to find Where Peppa is hiding.

27
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.103
Oh.

28
00:01:47.472 --> 00:01:49.030
Peppa isn't hiding under the table.

29
00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:55.476
George, have you thought of
looking upstairs?

30
00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:10.886
Peppa isn't under the bed.

31
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.766
What Was that strange noise?

32
00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.703
Peppa isn't behind the curtain.

33
00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.711
There is that strange noise again!

34
00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:29.636
What can it be?

35
00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.218
Whee !

36
00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:40.924
George has found Where
Peppa Was hiding.

37
00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:47.029
George found me!

38
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.293
Now it's Daddy's turn to hide!

39
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.292
Oh, I think George should
have another turn.

40
00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:56.501
But George isn't
very good at hiding...

41
00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.537
I'm sure he'll be better this time.

42
00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:01.178
Close your eyes and start counting.

43
00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:05.541
One... two...

44
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.818
three... Oh, dear. Peppa Will
easily find George. four...

45
00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:10.182

46
00:03:11.456 --> 00:03:13.253
six... George!
Come over here... seven...

47
00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:19.624
eight... nine... ten!

48
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.456
Ready or not, here I come!

49
00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:28.965
Oh, George isn't hiding
under the table!

50
00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.472
But George always
hides under the table!

51
00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:35.273
Have you thought of
looking upstairs?

52
00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.205
I know Where he is!

53
00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.213
George is in the toy basket.

54
00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.081
Oh.

55
00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:50.085
George is not in the toy basket!

56
00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:51.787
Where can he be?

57
00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:58.667
Peppa can not find George anywhere.

58
00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:01.929
Daddy? I can't find
George anywhere.

59
00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:06.572
Oh, dear, I Wonder Where he can be.

60
00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:13.310
Actually, I think
there's something

61
00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:15.509
about George in this
newspaper...

62
00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:20.317
Whee...

63
00:04:23.328 --> 00:04:25.626
George! Found you!

64
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:27.756
Oh, George!

65
00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.328
That Was a good place to hide!

66
00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.399
George Was hiding behind

67
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.697
Daddy Pig's newspaper
all the time!

68
00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:06.735
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
