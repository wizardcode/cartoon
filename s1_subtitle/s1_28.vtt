00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:07.064
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.902
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:11.133
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.635
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.416
Windy Castle!

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.911
Peppa and her family are
going out for the day.

6
00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:25.412
Peppa, George,

7
00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.785
today We are going to
Windy Castle!

8
00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:30.152
What's Windy Castle, Daddy?

9
00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.090
It's a castle on a very high hill!

10
00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.593
George likes castles.

11
00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.666
Windy Castle sounds like
a boring thing for boys.

12
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.105
No, Peppa, you'll love it.

13
00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.432
There's a great view
from the top of Windy Castle.

14
00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.377
You can even see Granny
and Grandpa's house!

15
00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.443
Wow! Let's go!

16
00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.246
I'll map-read and
Mummy Pig Will drive.

17
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.884
Are you sure, Daddy Pig?

18
00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:54.815
When you map-read,

19
00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.888
We always get lost
and you get grumpy.

20
00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.756
We Will not get lost
and I Will not get grumpy.

21
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.463
Windy Castle, here We come!

22
00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.034
Are We nearly there yet?

23
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:13.533
Not quite.

24
00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:14.533
Oh.

25
00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.101
Would you like
to play a game?

26
00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.970
Yes, please. Let's play
''I Spy!''

27
00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.207
Okay. I'll go first.

28
00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.779
Daddy Pig has to secretly
look at something

29
00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.346
and the others have to guess What it is.

30
00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:30.215
I spy With my little eye,
something colored ''red''.

31
00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:34.290
Red? My dress!
That's red!

32
00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.792
No. It's not your dress.

33
00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.496
Hmmmm.
The car!

34
00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:42.289
That's right!
Our red car.

35
00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:49.237
My go. I spy With my little eye,
something ''blue''

36
00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.734
Hmmm...
George's blue shirt!

37
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.435
Nope.

38
00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.809
ls it something in the car?

39
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.442
No. Give up?

40
00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:57.241
Yes.

41
00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:01.384
The sky! The blue sky!
I Win.

42
00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.321
Daddy Pig? Do you
know Where We are?

43
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.320
I know exactly Where We are.

44
00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:10.093
Although... this road

45
00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.763
doesn't look the same
as it does on the map.

46
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.763
Oh, Daddy Pig!
We're lost!

47
00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:17.462
We are not lost.

48
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.398
So how do We get to
Windy Castle from here?

49
00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:24.042
Just give me a moment.
Hmmmm!

50
00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.404
I know, We can ring
Granny and Grandpa.

51
00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.771
There's no need to ring
Granny and Grandpa.

52
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.915
I'll get us to Windy Castle,
if it takes me all day.

53
00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:33.974
We haven't got all day.

54
00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:41.492
Hello, Grandpa Pig speaking.

55
00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:42.916
Grandpa Pig,

56
00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.691
We've got a bit lost
on the Way to Windy Castle.

57
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.931
ls Daddy Pig doing
the map-reading?

58
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.937
Yes, Daddy Pig is doing
the map-reading.

59
00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.003
And he's a bit grumpy
at the moment.

60
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.505
I am not grumpy.

61
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.307
This is the best route:

62
00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.073
keep on the main road

63
00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.508
until you see Windy Castle
up ahead.

64
00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.082
Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

65
00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:11.145
We follow the main road
and look out for Windy Castle.

66
00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:12.154
As I thought.

67
00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.891
Look!
ls that a castle?

68
00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:19.153
Yes! It's Windy Castle!

69
00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:22.233
Come on, car!

70
00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:25.095
Come on, car! You can make it!

71
00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:27.829
Hurray!

72
00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:30.965
Peppa and her family have
arrived at Windy Castle.

73
00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.101
Wow! It's so tall!

74
00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.041
Let's go inside. The view
from the top is fantastic!

75
00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:43.986
Wow!

76
00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:45.981
Look at the view!

77
00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.284
Mummy, is that Granny and
Grandpa's house?

78
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.123
Yes, it is!

79
00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.292
It's so far away!

80
00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.133
Let's take a look
through the telescope.

81
00:03:58.203 --> 00:03:59.636
Can I look first, please?

82
00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.300
Yes, but you must let
George look next.

83
00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:04.269
Wow!

84
00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:06.934
The telescope makes
everything look bigger.

85
00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.637
I can see
Granny and Grandpa!

86
00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.279
Look, George!

87
00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.777
Ganggy lg! Baba lg!

88
00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.717
George is Waving at
Granny and Grandpa Pig.

89
00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:20.151
Silly George!

90
00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:24.523
Granny and Grandpa are
too far away to see you Waving!

91
00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:26.794
I know! We can ring them!

92
00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:30.965
Hello?

93
00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:34.665
Grandpa Pig! We can see you
from Windy Castle!

94
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.670
Wave at us!

95
00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.336
Granny and Grandpa
are Waving at us!

96
00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:41.736
I love Windy Castle!

97
00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:07.096
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
