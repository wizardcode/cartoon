00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:06.735
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:08.799
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.236
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:14.534
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:21.611
The Playgroup

5
00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.549
Peppa and George are going
to the playgroup.

6
00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.623
It is George's first day.

7
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.120
George, are you looking forward

8
00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.129
to the playgroup?

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.460
Daddy, maybe George is too small

10
00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.262
to go to my playgroup?

11
00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:42.969
He'll be fine, Peppa.

12
00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.403
There'll be you and Mr. Dinosaur
there to keep him company.

13
00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:49.272
Grrr! Dine-Saw!

14
00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.983
But I Want to play With
the big children!

15
00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:55.851
Not George and his toy dinosaur.

16
00:00:56.788 --> 00:00:58.278
Oh dear, Peppa doesn't Want

17
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.980
George to go to her playgroup.

18
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:07.095
We're here!

19
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.859
Daddy, are you sure
George is big enough?

20
00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:13.498
He'll be fine.

21
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:19.169
Alright, he can come.

22
00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:22.446
Bye bye.

23
00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.890
Madame Gazelle looks after the
children at the playgroup.

24
00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:39.687

28
00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.040

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.839
Woof Woof! ls that a dinosaur?

30
00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.484
It's just a toy dinosaur.

31
00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:04.354
Grrr! Dine-Saw!

32
00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.918

That's brilliant!

38
00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:26.375
George is my brother.
He's brilliant.

39
00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.073
Peppa is proud of her
little brother, George.

40
00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:37.517
Shall We show George
how We paint pictures?

41
00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.519
George is not very good at painting.

42
00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:42.116
Well, maybe
you could help him?

43
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.388
Yes, I'm very good!

44
00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:48.263
I Will show him
how to paint a flower.

45
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:52.195
George, today I'm going to

46
00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:53.701
teach you how to paint a flower.

47
00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.204
First, you paint a big circle.

48
00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:05.110
No, George, that's the Wrong color.

49
00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:09.118
Now you paint the flower's petals.

50
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.925
George! That's the Wrong shape!

51
00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:18.794
Now you paint the
stalk and the leaves.

52
00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:22.491
Perfect!

53
00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:28.497
George, you've done it all Wrong!

54
00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:32.633
Now What do We have here?

55
00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.173
I've painted a flower.

56
00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:37.744
That's very good, Peppa.

57
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.244
And George has painted a dinosaur.

58
00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.452
Grrr... Dine-Saw!

59
00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.820
Woof! Brilliant!

60
00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.521
I think George and Peppa's pictures
should go on the Wall.

61
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:56.766
Hurray!

62
00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:01.094
Peppa, You must be very proud of

63
00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:02.668
your little brother.

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:04.606
Yes, I am.

65
00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:09.671
It is home time and

66
00:04:10.048 --> 00:04:12.039
the children's parents are
here to pick them up.

67
00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:14.713
Can George come next time?

68
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.617
Yes, and he can paint us
another Iovely picture.

69
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:21.854
And What Will you
paint next time, George?

70
00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:23.991
Dine-Saw! Grrr!

73
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:31.298
how to paint a dinosaur?

74
00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:34.705
