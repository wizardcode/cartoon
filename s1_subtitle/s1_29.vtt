surprise for everyone.

Everyone loves pancakes!

11
00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:44.564
I'm the expert at
flipping the pancakes over!

12
00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:45.708
Leave that to me!

13
00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.571
Are you sure,Daddy Pig?

14
00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:48.576
Last time you got a bit grumpy

15
00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:50.704
When you dropped the pancake on the floor.

16
00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:52.945
I did not get grumpy.

17
00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:55.582
There Was a problem With the frying pan.

18
00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.581
Mummy. Can We help make
the pancakes, please?

19
00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:04.957
Yes. You can help me
make the batter.

20
00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:07.454
First, I put some
flour in the bowl.

21
00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.098
Ooooo!

22
00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:11.963
Now, I add an egg.

23
00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:16.237
Now, the milk.

24
00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:19.468
And I give it all a stir.

25
00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:22.474
Mummy, can I stir?

26
00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:23.979
Yes, of course Peppa.

27
00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:26.741
Peppa loves stirring.

28
00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:28.979
George Wants to stir as Well.

29
00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:34.254
No, George, like this!

30
00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:39.991
Ok, that's enough stirring.

31
00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:41.391
You two sit at the table

32
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:42.622
While I cook the pancakes.

33
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.273
Mummy Pig is going to flip
the pancake over!

34
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.712
Hurray!

35
00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.342
You could flip it higher,
Mummy Pig.

36
00:02:00.518 --> 00:02:02.281
You can show us how,

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.646
When you flip your own
pancake, Daddy Pig.

38
00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:06.517
This first pancake is for George.

39
00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.783
Mummy Pig pours a little
syrup on George's pancake.

40
00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:14.426
Delicious!

41
00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.431
This pancake is for Peppa.

42
00:02:19.804 --> 00:02:21.032
Hurray!

43
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.032
Hmmm... you could flip it
higher, Mummy Pig.

44
00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:27.943
You Will get a chance
to show me

45
00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:29.168
When you flip you own
pancake, Daddy Pig.

46
00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:31.040
Syrup, please!

47
00:02:36.187 --> 00:02:37.677
Mmmmmm!
Delicious!

48
00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:42.554
This pancake is
for Mummy Pig.

49
00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:44.957
Hurray!

50
00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:48.956
You still aren't flipping
them high enough,

51
00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:49.965
Mummy Pig.

52
00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:51.968
The next pancake is
yours, Daddy Pig.

53
00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:53.964
So now you can show us
how it should be done.

54
00:02:58.276 --> 00:02:59.709
Mmmmmm!
Delicious!

55
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.071
ls everyone Watching?

56
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.579
The secret of making
a good pancake

57
00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:10.582
is to flip it high into the air.

58
00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:16.850
One... two... three...
hoopla!

59
00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:21.991
Silly Daddy!

60
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.724
Oh...maybe that Was
just a bit too high.

61
00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:28.595
What a shame,
that Was the last pancake.

62
00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:31.007
It should be a simple
matter to get it down.

63
00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:36.606
Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot
reach his pancake.

64
00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:38.508
Don't Worry, Daddy Pig,

65
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.377
I think I know a Way
to get it down.

66
00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:42.117
Let's go upstairs, children.

67
00:03:44.622 --> 00:03:45.452
This Way!

68
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.524
What is Mummy Pig
planning to do?

69
00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:51.261
On the count of three,

70
00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.326
We all have to start
jumping up and down.

71
00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:56.761
One... two... three...
jump!

72
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.637
What are they doing?

73
00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:13.546
It Worked!

74
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:15.284
Now Daddy Pig has his pancake.

75
00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:17.652
Daddy has a pancake on his head!

76
00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.487
Syrup on your pancake,
Daddy Pig?

77
00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:24.056
Yes, please.

78
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:32.162
One... two... three...
hoopla!

79
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:38.373
Mmmmmm!
Delicious!

80
00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:42.674
Silly Daddy.

81
00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:07.160

This is my little brother, George.
