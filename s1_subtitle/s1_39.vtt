Granny Pig!

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:29.058
Ganggy lg!

8
00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:30.685
Hello, my little ones!

9
00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:33.428
Before you come in the house,

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:34.825
you must take off
your muddy boots.

11
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.862
Yes, Granny.

12
00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:41.769
Peppa, George,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.267

Little curtains!

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:45.765

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.342
What are the little
curtains for, Granny?

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.145
It's a surprise!

17
00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:52.072
Do you Want to see

18
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.378

19
00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:54.643
Yes, please,

20
00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:02.791
Grandpa Pig!

21
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:04.219

00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:09.093
Look What I've made for you.

24
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.159
A tree house!

25
00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:13.800
A tree house! For
George and me?

26
00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:18.738
And the little curtains are
for your tree house!

27
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:21.605
Hurray!

28
00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:24.878
Peppa and George love
their tree house!

29
00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:28.313
Thank you, Granny Pig!
Thank you, Grandpa Pig!

30
00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:32.422
Who Wants
to go inside first?

31
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.622
Me! Me!

32
00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:35.422
ln you go then!

33
00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:40.928
Before I go in my tree house,
I must take off my muddy boots!

34
00:01:43.568 --> 00:01:47.937
I'm in my tree house!
I'm in my tree house!

35
00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:53.133
George? Would you like
to go in the tree house, too?

36
00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:58.004
Yes? Who is it?

37
00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:59.841
A young pig named ''George''

38
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:02.511
Would like to pay a visit.
Can he come in?

39
00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:05.278
As long as he takes off
his muddy boots.

40
00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:07.151
George, take your boots off,

41
00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:09.223
then you can visit Peppa
in the tree house.

42
00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:13.961
Who is it?

43
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:15.962
George?

44
00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:22.803
Yes? Who is it?

45
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:24.533
It's Mummy Pig.

46
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.470
Have you room for any
more visitors?

47
00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.313
Hmmmm. You have to say
the secret Words.

48
00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:32.243
Then you can come into our house.

49
00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:36.381
I see. And What are
the secret Words?

50
00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:38.956
I have to Whisper them to you.

51
00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:43.188
The secret Words are
''Daddy's Big Tummy!''

52
00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:44.392
I see!

53
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.961
Say the secret Words!

54
00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:52.001
''Daddy's Big Tummy.''

55
00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:55.331
That's right!
''Daddy's Big Tummy!!''

56
00:02:56.507 --> 00:02:58.771
I think those are silly
secret Words.

57
00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:04.079
Mummy, before you come in our house,

58
00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.577
you must take off your boots.

59
00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:07.012
Of course.

60
00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.518
There's room for Daddy, too!

61
00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:16.860
Say the secret Words, Daddy!

62
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:20.096
Can I have different
secret Words, please?

63
00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:21.229
No!

64
00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:26.733
Oh, all right.
''Daddy's Big Tummy.''

65
00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:29.305
That's right!

66
00:03:29.607 --> 00:03:32.940
You can come in now, Daddy!
Take your boots off!

67
00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:40.250
Er. I don't think I can
fit through the door.

68
00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.749
That's because your tummy
is too big!

69
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.326
I know! Daddy Pig can
climb in through the top!

70
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.325
Peppa, George, Mummy Pig
and Daddy Pig

71
00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:55.829
are all in the tree house!

72
00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:59.462
Granny, I love our tree house!

73
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.568
I don't Want to ever come out!

74
00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:03.400
That's nice, Peppa.

75
00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.541
But are you sure you don't
Want to visit me in my house?

76
00:04:06.844 --> 00:04:08.402
No, thank you, Granny.

77
00:04:09.647 --> 00:04:11.911
ln that case,
Grandpa Pig and I Will

78
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.085
just have to eat my homemade
cookies all by ourselves.

79
00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:22.156
Coookies!
Granny Pig!

80
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.085
Here are my home-made cookies!

81
00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.927
But, if you Want to come in,

82
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:29.055
you have to say the secret Words.

83
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.663
That's easy!
''Daddy's Big Tummy!''

84
00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:33.936
That's right!

85
00:04:35.873 --> 00:04:37.807
Well, I still think that those are

86
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.306
very silly secret Words.
