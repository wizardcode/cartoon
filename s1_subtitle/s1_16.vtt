00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:07.133
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:08.899
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:11.335
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:14.643
Peppa Pig.

4
00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:22.349
Hiccups!

5
00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:31.661
Peppa, George, Mummy and Daddy
are having breakfast.

6
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.924
It is a Iovely, sunny day,

7
00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:37.223
and Peppa and George can't Wait
to go into the garden to play.

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.104
Mummy, please,
can We go out to play?

9
00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:44.239
You can go out to play
When you finish your breakfast.

10
00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:54.451
George! Don't drink
your juice too quickly!

11
00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.688
George drank his juice too quickly,

12
00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:04.685
and now he has hiccups.

13
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.695
Can We go out to play now,
Mummy?

14
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.762
Not While George has hiccups.

15
00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:14.398
But George's hiccups
have gone, Mummy.

16
00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:15.697
Haven't they, George?

17
00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:24.477
Oh, alright, you can
go out and play.

18
00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:25.976
But look after George.

19
00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.223
Peppa and George love
playing in the garden.

20
00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:37.223
George. I'm going to throw the ball,

21
00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:38.792
and then you have to catch it.

22
00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.990
George, please stop hiccupping!

23
00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:52.135
George! Now you
throw the ball to me,

24
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.242
and I have to catch it.

25
00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:58.504
George!

26
00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:02.650
Oh, dear, George's hiccups
are spoiling the game.

27
00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.950
George... I know
how to cure hiccups!

28
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:08.752
You have to do What I say.

29
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.025
Rub the top of your head
and rub your tummy!

30
00:02:19.837 --> 00:02:22.203
Good! Now your hiccups
have gone!

31
00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:28.275
Peppa's cure for hiccups
doesn't seem to have Worked.

32
00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:31.045
George! You have
done it all Wrong!

33
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:35.785
I know a better Way
to cure hiccups!

34
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:40.284
First, jump up and down
three times... on one leg!

35
00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:47.054
Now... Wave your arms
up and down

36
00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:49.192
and stick your tongue out!

37
00:02:56.307 --> 00:02:58.571
... And now...
close your eyes,

38
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.870
and turn around quickly,
three times!

39
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.220
Peppa's new cure hasn't Worked, either.

40
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:12.817
George still has hiccups.

41
00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:16.082
I know!

42
00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:20.525
To cure hiccups, the ill piggy
must be given a shock!

43
00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.757
George, I'm going to scare you.

44
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.024
But you must remember,

45
00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:28.231
it's only a game and
it Will stop your hiccups.

46
00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.738
Remember, this is
just pretend scaring.

47
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:43.115
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

48
00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:46.348
Peppa! You mustn't
play so roughly With George!

49
00:03:46.624 --> 00:03:47.556
He's only little.

50
00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:49.625
Sorry, Mummy.

51
00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:52.361
I Was just trying to stop
George's hiccups.

52
00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.857
George's hiccups have gone!

53
00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:02.435
Here comes Daddy Pig,
With two beakers of juice.

54
00:04:06.277 --> 00:04:07.869
George! lf you drink too quickly,

55
00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:09.135
you Will get hiccups again!

56
00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:11.706
I'm not as little as George.

57
00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:14.784
I can drink juice
as quickly as I Want to!

58
00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:06.826
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
