00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.530
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.298
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.736
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.235
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.745
Secrets.

5
00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.260
Mummy Pig has made
a special box for Peppa.

6
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.559
Peppa, this box is just for you!

7
00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.261
Thank you, Mummy!

8
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:38.064
It's a secret box for you
to keep secret things in.

9
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.432
What things can I put in it,
Mummy?

10
00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.334
Only you can
decide that, Peppa!

11
00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.134
It's your secret box!

12
00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.080
I know What I
can put in it!

13
00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.279
Good.
But don't tell me.

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.650
I Won't tell you
or George or Daddy!

15
00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.719
It's a secret!!

16
00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.156
George,
this is my secret box!

17
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.662
It's empty. I have to find
some things to put inside.

18
00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.796
George Wants to
help Peppa.

19
00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:15.098
No, George, only I must know
What's in the box.

20
00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.309
You have to Wait outside
While I choose.

21
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.807
Peppa is going to choose some
secret things to put in the box.

22
00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.983
Now, my secret box is full!

23
00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.627
George, you must not look inside!

24
00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.890
George Would like to know

25
00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.959
What is inside
Peppa's secret box.

26
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.634
lf you like,
you can try to guess.

27
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.463
Dine-Saw!

28
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.264
George thinks Peppa has
put a dinosaur in the box!

29
00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.774
Oh, George!

30
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.343
You always say ''dinosaur''
for everything!

31
00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:59.208
Anyway, a dinosaur
is too big to fit in the box.

32
00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.221
George cannot guess What is
in Peppa's secret box.

33
00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:06.151
Daddy Pig is
cleaning a picture.

34
00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.018
Daddy! This is my
secret box!

35
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.862
Mummy made it for me!

36
00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.162
It's very nice, Peppa!
What's inside?

37
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.665
It's a secret!

38
00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.434
George tried to guess,
but he didn't get it right.

39
00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.036
Can I have a try?

40
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.305
Yes.

41
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.677
Hmmm. Have you put my glasses inside?

42
00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:32.543
No!!! Your glasses are
on your head!

43
00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:33.548
So they are!

44
00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:37.384
Silly Daddy! You must
have a proper guess.

45
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:41.191
Ok. Have you put
Mummy's shoes in the box?

46
00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.192
Nope! And that's all your
guesses. Used up!

47
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.331
Peppa likes secrets!

48
00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:51.333
Mummy! No one knows
What is in my box!

49
00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.770
Oh. What has George got?

50
00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.835
I made a box for George, too!

51
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.905
And he's filled it
With secret things!

52
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.413
And only George knows
What's inside.

53
00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:03.714
Oh.

54
00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.481
Peppa Would like to know
What is inside George's box.

55
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.481
It's George's toy dinosaur, of course!

56
00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:11.781
No!

57
00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.785
George's toy dinosaur
is not in George's box.

58
00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:19.425
It's too difficult!
I'll never guess!

59
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.993
Peppa does not like secrets
as much as she used to.

60
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.568
Maybe, if you showed George
one thing from your box,

61
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.806
then he could show you
one thing from his.

62
00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:31.566
Ok. But We must do it
at the same time.

63
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.741
That's a good idea.
On the count of three,

64
00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.877
you each show What's
in your boxes.

65
00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.111
Ready?

66
00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.080
Yes.

67
00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:41.613
One... two... THREe!

68
00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.754
George has a drum
and Peppa has a trumpet.

69
00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:52.522
Lovely!

70
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.524
Yes, it sounds very nice.

71
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.759
Do you have anymore
secret things?

72
00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.031
George has a custard doughnut!

73
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.035
Oh.

74
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.538
But Peppa's box
is empty.

75
00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.404
I've got nothing else!

76
00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:09.474
Luckily, I have!
Come on. Tuck in.

77
00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.547
George, Peppa,
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig

78
00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.149
all like custard doughnuts!

79
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.978
I don't have a special box.

80
00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.921
But I know a very good place
to hide my custard doughnut!

81
00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.557
Can you guess Where?

82
00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:25.855
Um. Are you going to
hide it in the fridge?

83
00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.998
No! Somewhere much more special!

84
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.291
My tummy!

85
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.430
Mmmmmm! Delicious!

86
00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.799
I'm going to hide mine
in my tummy!

87
00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:39.008
Me, too!

88
00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:06.799
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
