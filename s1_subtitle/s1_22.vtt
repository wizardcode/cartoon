00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:07.160
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.031
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:11.368
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:14.667
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:21.681
Babysitting!

5
00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:27.686
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig
are going out for the evening.

6
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.889
Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig
are going to baby-sit.

7
00:00:31.262 --> 00:00:33.628
Granny Pig, Grandpa Pig!

8
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:36.190
Ganggy lg! Baba lg!

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.127
Hello, my little ones!

10
00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:39.625
Hello.

11
00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:42.468
Peppa, George.
lnto your beds! Quick!

12
00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.570
Goodnight, my little piggies!

13
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:48.469
Goodnight. Sleep tight!

14
00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:51.643
Goodnight, Mummy.
Goodnight, Daddy!

15
00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:54.707
What little darlings!

16
00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:57.411
Now go to sleep quickly.

17
00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:58.488
Yes, Mummy.

18
00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.222
So Well behaved!

19
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.856
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are
leaving for their evening out.

20
00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.737
Peppa and George are so good.

21
00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:21.809
They just fell asleep

22
00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:23.241
When Mummy Pig told them to!

23
00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.242
This babysitting is easy!

24
00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:33.621
George? George, are you awake?

25
00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:44.195
Shhh!

26
00:01:53.277 --> 00:01:54.403
What strange noises.

27
00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:57.980
I Wonder if We should
check upstairs...

28
00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:10.425
Peppa, George?
Are you awake?

29
00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.666
Well, I never, fast asleep.

30
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:23.667
So, it Wasn't Peppa and
George making all that noise.

31
00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:32.806
I can't hear anything.

32
00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:36.081
I think they really have fallen asleep.

33
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:38.516
Let's Watch some television.

34
00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:43.760
Gardening. Today We are
talking about ''Roses''.

35
00:02:43.894 --> 00:02:47.091
Oh, I love
gardening programs!

36
00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.692
The Gavesgate is a
particularly thorny rose.

37
00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:55.332
To prune it, start by
lopping off the head

38
00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:57.264
and then snip away
the budding shoots.

39
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.702
Granny Pig?

40
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.276
Peppa? George?

41
00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:04.547
You should be in bed asleep!

42
00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:06.773
George and I
are not sleepy at all.

43
00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:09.275
Can We Watch Tv
With you?

44
00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:11.344
Well... I suppose Watching a little Tv

45
00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:13.614
might make you sleepy.

46
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.855
Hurray!

47
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.425
Icelandic Roses are a rare treat

48
00:03:18.562 --> 00:03:20.860
for the discerning
horticulturist.

49
00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:23.128
But they are prone to lobbing

50
00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.231
in temperate habitats.

51
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.134
This program is very boring.

52
00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:31.365
Grandpa Pig?
Can you play that game

53
00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:33.872
Where you throw us up
and catch us?

54
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:37.308
Okay, but just one turn each!

55
00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.078
Wheeeee!

56
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.079
Phew... You seem
heavier than before.

57
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.817
Now it's
George's turn.

58
00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:49.386
Wheeee!

59
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:51.887
My turn!

60
00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:53.391
Wheee!

61
00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:55.757
Higher! Higher!

62
00:03:57.601 --> 00:03:59.592
Maybe Grandpa Pig
is a bit tired.

63
00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:03.401
I know! Granny Pig, let's play catch!

64
00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:04.836
Err...

65
00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.604
You're ''It''!
Catch us if you can!

66
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.276
Can't catch me!

67
00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:11.403
I'm going to catch you!

68
00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:23.553
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig
are back home.

69
00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:26.189
I hope our little piggies
are asleep.

70
00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:30.856
Hello? Anyone here?

71
00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.197
The little piggies
are asleep!

72
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:38.870
And so are the big piggies!
