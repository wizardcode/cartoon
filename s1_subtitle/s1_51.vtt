00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:07.027
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:11.097
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:14.842
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.107
Daddy's Movie Camera!

5
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.177
Mr. Zebra, the postman, is

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.047
delivering a parcel
to Peppa's house.

7
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:28.854
Parcel for you, Mr. Pig!

8
00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:33.124
Thank you, Mr. Zebra.
Goodbye!

9
00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.360
Look! I just got a parcel in the post!

10
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.431
Can anyone guess What's inside?

11
00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:41.636
Dine-Saw!

12
00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:47.368
Oh, George! You always say
''dinosaur'' for everything!

13
00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:50.140
The parcel
is far too small

14
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:51.712
to have a dinosaur inside!

15
00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.883
Hmmm... I think it's
a... a new toy!

16
00:00:56.788 --> 00:00:57.880
You're very close.

17
00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:59.651
I know What it is!

18
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.883
Your new camera!
A new toy for Daddy Pig!

19
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:07.894
That's right!
It's a movie camera!

20
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.591
We can make movies With it

21
00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:11.729
and Watch them on our television!

22
00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:14.102
Can I use it first, Daddy?

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.674
It's a bit too
difficult for children to use.

24
00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:20.041
Even I need to read the instructions!

25
00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:24.105
Hmmm. It's a bit harder than I thought...

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.810
Suzy Sheep's mummy has
a movie camera.

27
00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.549
She switches it on like this.

28
00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:34.422
Oh. Well done, Peppa.

29
00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:37.687
Beep! Beep! Thank you for purchasing
the movie 3000!

30
00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.194
Beep! Beep! I am eager and ready

31
00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:41.061
to shoot your first movie. Beep Beep!

32
00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.326
ls there a Way to turn that voice off ?

33
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:44.759
Err. I'm not sure.

34
00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:46.763
Beep! Beep!
Thank you for purchasing

35
00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:48.271
the movie 3000!
Beep! Beep!

36
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.430
On Suzy's camera,

37
00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:53.074
you just press this button
to stop it talking.

38
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.769
Beep! Beep!
Thank you for purchasing ....

39
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.509
Now it Won't talk anymore.

40
00:01:57.782 --> 00:01:59.079
Well done, Peppa.

41
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.781
What shall I film first?

42
00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:02.218
Film me!

43
00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:04.720
Ok, Peppa!

44
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.217
Hello! I'm Peppa Pig!

45
00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:13.089
Come on, everyone.

46
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.466
Hello! I'm Peppa Pig!

47
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.598
Again! Again!

48
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:24.366
Ok!

49
00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:29.303
Hello! I'm Peppa Pig!

50
00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:32.878
Again! Again!

51
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.485
Hello! I'm Peppa Pig!

52
00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:40.485
Again! Again!

53
00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:43.323
Maybe We should
film something new!

54
00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:46.496
I know! Daddy Pig
must leave the room

55
00:02:46.764 --> 00:02:48.129
and We'll make a movie
to show him!

56
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:49.822
This Way.

57
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:51.259
Daddy Pig has to Wait
in the kitchen,

58
00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:54.767
While Mummy Pig, Peppa and George
make a secret movie!

59
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:58.768
No peeking ,Daddy Pig!

60
00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.269
We must all have to do something.

61
00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:05.780
George? Do you Want to go first?

62
00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:12.148
Are you ready?

63
00:03:12.223 --> 00:03:13.656
Can I come in and
see the movie?

64
00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:16.419
Finished! You can come in now!

65
00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:20.296
George has made a movie
and so has Peppa!

66
00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.160
Let's see George's movie first!

67
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:25.801
Dine-saw.

68
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.660
Grrrrr!

69
00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.305
George is pretending
to be a dinosaur.

70
00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:31.934
Grrrrr!

71
00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:34.307
That's a very scary dinosaur.

72
00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:36.370
GRRrrrrrrRRRRRr!

73
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.679
Oh, dear, George is frightened!

74
00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.313
Don't be frightened, George,

75
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.555
that's not a real dinosaur on Tv,
it's you!

76
00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.050
Grrrrrrrrrr!

77
00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:49.685
Dine-Saw!

78
00:03:52.563 --> 00:03:54.394
Now, let's see Peppa's movie.

79
00:03:57.568 --> 00:03:59.263
Who is that meant to be?

80
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.400
I am Daddy Pig!

81
00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:05.073
I see.

82
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.201
My tummy is very big

83
00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:12.912
because I eat a lot of cookies!

84
00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:16.586
My tummy is not big!

85
00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:19.589
But it is true that I like cookies.

86
00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:22.591
And the more you eat,
the bigger your tummy gets!

87
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.856
Ok, What's next?

88
00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:29.866
This is my sweet little brother, George.

89
00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:32.096
This is Mummy Pig.

90
00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:33.926
This is me.

91
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:39.943
And this is the real Daddy Pig.
