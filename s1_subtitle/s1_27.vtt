I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.668
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.036
And this is Daddy Pig.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.478
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.751
Not Very Well!

5
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.617
Mummy and Daddy Pig

6
00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.983
have just made breakfast
for Peppa and George.

7
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.918
Breakfast is ready!

8
00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.259
Peppa has red spots on her face!

9
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.698
Mummy, I don't feel very Well.

10
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.708
Oh, dear, Peppa. You don't look very Well.

11
00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.006
Don't Worry. I'll ring Dr. Brown-Bear.

12
00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.211
Dr. Brown-Bear speaking.

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.214
Peppa is not very Well.

14
00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.647
Her face is covered in red spots!

15
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:02.425
Put Peppa to bed and
I'll come straight round.

16
00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.524
Dr. Brown Bear has come to
make Peppa better.

17
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.797
Hello, Peppa, how are you today?

18
00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.231
I am not very Well.

19
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.434
Stick your tongue out, please.

20
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.677
Hmmm... It's not anything serious.

21
00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.468
Peppa has just got a rash.

22
00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.612
Do I need medicine?!

23
00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.747
The rash Will clear up quickly.

24
00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:28.452
But if you like, I can give
you just a little medicine.

25
00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.613
Yes, please.

26
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.756
I'm afraid it doesn't taste very nice.

27
00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.317
Open Wide, please.

28
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.191
Eeuuurgh! Disgusting!

29
00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.832
You are a brave little one
for taking it so Well.

30
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.631
Peppa must stay in bed.

31
00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.836
I'll call back later
to check that she is better.

32
00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.574
Can Peppa have visitors?

33
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.142
Oh, yes, she can have visitors.

34
00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.213
The rash isn't catching. Goodbye!

35
00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.711
Goodbye! Dr. Brown Bear!

36
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.718
Mummy, can I get up now?

37
00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.143
Dr. Brown Bear says that

38
00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.153
you must stay in bed
for a little bit, Peppa.

39
00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.152
But it's so boring!

40
00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.853
Dr. Brown Bear did say
you could have visitors.

41
00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.297
Can Suzy Sheep visit me?

42
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.160
Suzy Sheep is Peppa's best friend.

43
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.298
I'll ring Suzy Sheep's mummy.

44
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.667
Hello, Mrs. Pig.

45
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.867
May Peppa talk With Suzy, please?

46
00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.372
Hello, Suzy!

47
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.507

50
00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.679
Yes, Dr. Brown Bear Was here!

51
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.188
He said I Was not very Well

52
00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.518
and that I Was very brave.

53
00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.689
So are you really ill?

54
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.196
Yes, yes! It's not pretend!

55
00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.060
I have to stay in bed!

56
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.029
Dr. Brown Bear

57
00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:53.400
gave me medicine that
tasted really horrible!

58
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.039
I'm coming to see you!

59
00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.268
I'm going to Wear my
nurse's outfit!!!

60
00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.210

61
00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.706
Suzy is Wearing her nurse's costume.

62
00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.349
Danny Dog and Rebecca Rabbit

63
00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.718
Hello, Peppa!

64
00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:13.720

How do you feel?

66
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.558
I am not very Well, Suzy.

67
00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.293
I have to stay in bed.

68
00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.569
What can We do to make you better?

69
00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.865
You could get me some orange juice.

70
00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.171
Ok!

71
00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.938
Peppa seems to be quite enjoying herself.

72
00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.612
Thank you, Suzy.

73
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.441
Do you feel any better?

74
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.752
A little bit. Danny,

75
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:42.749
Woof!

76
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:43.878
Ask my mummy

77
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.885
if I could have some ice cream.

78
00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:46.954
And Rebecca,

79
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.752
could you bring me
some flowers from the garden?

80
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.119
Dr. Brown Bear is here,

81
00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.756
to see if Peppa is better.

82
00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.758
Ah, good, the nurse is already here!

83
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.396
How is the patient?

84
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:03.274
Err... I'm not a real nurse,
it's just pretend.

85
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.273
I see. Would you like me
to take a look myself?

86
00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:08.706
Yes, please.

87
00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.282
I say! No more red spots!
You're completely better!

88
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.282
Aren't I still a bit ill?

89
00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:17.781
How do you feel?

90
00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.116
I think I should stay in bed
a little bit more.

91
00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.163
Hmm.. I fancy a game With this ball
in the garden!!
