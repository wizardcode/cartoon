I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:08.762
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:11.269
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.768
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.576
Musical lnstruments

5
00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.522
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig have
been tidying the house.

6
00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:33.961
Mummy Pig and I
found this old box in the attic!

7
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.722
Ooo!

8
00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:38.033
Can anyone guess What's inside?

9
00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:40.464
Hmmm, nope!

10
00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.797
It's full of musical instruments!

11
00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:45.306
Wow!

12
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:49.247
They are a bit old and dusty.

13
00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:57.819
This is the violin I used to play
When I Was little!

14
00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:00.757
Mummy? Can you play your violin?

15
00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:03.318
I haven't played it for a long time!

16
00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.060
Please, Mummy!
Please play it!

17
00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:08.560
I hope I haven't forgotten how...

18
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:16.339
Bravo!

19
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:17.573
Hurray!

20
00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.773
Mummy? Can I play the violin?

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.342
Hold it like this.

22
00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:24.571
Yes, Mummy.

23
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.850
Oh!

24
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.586
Oh, dear. I do not think it is
meant to sound like that.

25
00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:36.856
George Wants to try.

26
00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:38.858
Hold it like this, George.

27
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:43.863
Oh!

28
00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:45.792
That does not sound quite right, either.

29
00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.869
The violin is too hard to play!

30
00:01:49.407 --> 00:01:52.376
Peppa! Maybe you Would do better
With this tin drum,.

31
00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:54.102
Thank you, Daddy.

32
00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:56.102
That sounds better!

33
00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.040
Peppa loves playing the drum.

34
00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:00.544
Lovely.

35
00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.382
Yes, it sounds very nice.

36
00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:07.114
This is Daddy Pig's old accordion.

37
00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:10.889
I used to play this to Mummy Pig
When We first met...

38
00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:16.892
Oh... Daddy Pig. I remember this tune.

39
00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:24.837
George Wants to play
the accordion, too!

40
00:02:25.143 --> 00:02:28.635
Are you sure, George?
The accordion is quite difficult.

41
00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:35.410
George. The a-cro-dion is almost
as difficult to play as my drum.

42
00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:38.583
Ok, George.

43
00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:45.292
Oh!

44
00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:48.656
Maybe George is a bit too little
to play the accordion.

45
00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:52.430
Daddy? What other instruments
are in the box?

46
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:54.668
Just this horn!

47
00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:56.437
Can I try?

48
00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.540
You have to blow it very hard!

49
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.879
That does not sound right.

50
00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:05.940
It's impossible!

51
00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.613
I think I used to be able to play it...

52
00:03:12.457 --> 00:03:14.186
That really does not sound right.

53
00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.192
Maybe it just needs someone
big and strong like me!

54
00:03:26.204 --> 00:03:27.637
That does not sound right, either.

55
00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:33.201
Peppa's right; it is impossible to play.

56
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:36.708
Never mind, Daddy Pig.
Just stick to the accordion.

57
00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:38.638
You play it beautifully!

58
00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.714
Well, I do play it quite nicely,

59
00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.716
even if I say so myself.

60
00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:45.713
And I'll play my violin!

61
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:47.986
And I Will play my drum!

62
00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.217
Mummy Pig plays the violin.

63
00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:53.423
Daddy Pig plays the accordion.

64
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.989
Peppa plays the drum.

65
00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:01.163
But What instrument Will
George play?

66
00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.744
George is blowing the horn!

67
00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:17.515
Mummy couldn't play the horn and
Daddy couldn't play it.

68
00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.621
And even I couldn't play it!

69
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.525
But George can play it.

70
00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:07.127
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
