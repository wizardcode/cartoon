00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:06.661
I'm Peppa Pig
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.533
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:10.868
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.371
Peppa Pig.

4
00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.752
Daddy Loses his Glasses!

5
00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.194
Daddy Pig Wears glasses.

6
00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.704
He needs to Wear glasses to see clearly.

7
00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.702
When Daddy Pig Wears his glasses,

8
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.707
everything looks fine.

9
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.075
But When Daddy Pig
takes his glasses off...

10
00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.916
...he can't see things clearly.

11
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.587
Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy.

12
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.082
So, it is very important
that Daddy Pig knows

13
00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.285
Where his glasses are.

14
00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.808
Sometimes, Daddy Pig
loses his glasses.

15
00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:22.238
Peppa, George. Have you seen
Daddy Pig's glasses?

16
00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:23.947
He can't find them
anywhere.

17
00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:25.615
No, Mummy.

18
00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.743
Peppa and George do not know

19
00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.321
Where Daddy Pig's glasses are.

20
00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.458
Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot
see a thing Without them

21
00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.183
and it makes him very grumpy.

22
00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:40.456
Without his glasses on,

23
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.458
Daddy Pig cannot read
his newspaper.

24
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.633
This is ridiculous!
I can't see anything!

25
00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.772
Somebody must have
put my glasses somewhere.

26
00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.535
Do you remember
Where you last put them,

27
00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.476
Daddy Pig?

28
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.644
When I don't Wear them,

29
00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.577
I always put them
in my pocket.

30
00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.774
But they aren't there now.

31
00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.486
Daddy! Can We help find
your glasses?

32
00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.480
Good idea, Peppa.
lf you find them,

33
00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.590
Daddy Will stop
being so grumpy.

34
00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.359
I'm not grumpy.

35
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.226
Peppa and George are
looking for Daddy's glasses.

36
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.493
Peppa looks under the newspaper.

37
00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.873
But Daddy Pig's glasses
are not there.

38
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.601
Oh.

39
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.807
George looks on
top of the television.

40
00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.076
But Daddy Pig's glasses are not there.

41
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:30.377
Oh.

42
00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:35.446
Let's look upstairs in
Mummy and Daddy's bedroom!

43
00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.696
Peppa and George are looking in
Mummy and Daddy Pig's bedroom.

44
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.830
George... be careful not to
knock anything over.

45
00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:51.191
Argh!

46
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.403
It's not funny.

47
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:03.971
Peppa looks under the pillows.

48
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.045
But Daddy Pig's glasses
are not there.

49
00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:07.276
Oh.

50
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.786
George looks in
Daddy's slippers.

51
00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.421
But the glasses
are not there, either.

52
00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.228
Let's look in the bathroom!

53
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.731
Peppa and George are
looking in the bathroom.

54
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.569
The glasses are not in the bath.

55
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.732
Oh.

56
00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.673
The glasses are not in the toilet.

57
00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:33.074
Oh.

58
00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.571
Hmm ! It's too difficult.

59
00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.949
Peppa and George cannot find
Daddy Pig's glasses anywhere.

60
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.248
We've looked everywhere.

61
00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:48.584
But We can't find Daddy's glasses.

62
00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.462
Oh, dear. Now, What can We do?

63
00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.960
I suppose I'll just have to
learn to do Without them...

64
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.592
lf I move slowly,
I Won't bump into things.

65
00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.467
There they are!
Daddy's glasses!

66
00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:07.974
Daddy Pig. You Were
sitting on them all the time!

67
00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:09.842
Oh...

68
00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:13.276
Silly Daddy!

69
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.986
I don't know how they got there.

70
00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:21.920
I Wonder how!

71
00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:29.631
Well, you may have been a bit silly,

72
00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:32.365
