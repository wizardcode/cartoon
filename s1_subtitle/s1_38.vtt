00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:06.961
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.269
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.768
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.043
The Sleepy Princess!

5
00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:23.851
It is night time.

6
00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.986
Peppa and George are going to bed.

7
00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.919
Goodnight, Peppa and George!

8
00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:33.931
Mummy, Daddy?

9
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.492
Yes, Peppa?

10
00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.865
I am not sleepy.
Can I have a story?

11
00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:42.205
But maybe George is sleepy
and doesn't Want a story.

12
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.002
George, do you Want a story?
Say ''yes''!!

13
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.311
Alright! I Will
tell you just one story!

14
00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.645
lf Daddy Pig tells
you a story,

15
00:00:54.953 --> 00:00:57.444
you must both promise
to go to sleep.

16
00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:58.812
We promise!

17
00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:04.027
Hmmm. I think I'll tell you

18
00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.593
the story of ''The Sleepy Princess''.

19
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.829
ls it a good story?
It sounds a bit boring.

20
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.037
It's not boring!
It's very good!

21
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.474
ls there a little princess in it?

22
00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:19.039
Peppa! lf you keep talking,

23
00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.839
Daddy Pig can't start the story!

24
00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:22.102
Sorry, Mummy!

25
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.973
ls there a little princess
in the story, Daddy?

26
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.345
Yes, there is a
little princess in it.

27
00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.617
Hmmm... ''The Sleepy Princess.''

28
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.364
Once upon a time... in a castle,

29
00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:45.933
there lived a little princess.

30
00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:49.435
And she Was called
the Sleepy Princess.

31
00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:52.505
Daddy, Why Was she
called that?

32
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.076
I'll get to that later.

33
00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:56.372
Was the Sleepy Princess pretty?

34
00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.945
Yes, she Was very pretty!

35
00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.648
She loved looking at
herself in the mirror.

36
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.783
I am so pretty!

37
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.150
Who else Was living
in the castle?

38
00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:09.458
Er. Well...

39
00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:13.389
The others in the castle Were...
the small Prince,

40
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.666
Queen Mummy and King Daddy!

41
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:22.363
That's right! They Were all
living there as Well.

42
00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.601
Did King Daddy
have a big tummy?

43
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.368
Of course not! He Was very
handsome, like me.

44
00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.979
Anyway, there Was
also a dragon!

45
00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.608
Dine-Saw?

46
00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:37.046
A dinosaur? Oh, yes,

47
00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:39.916
it Wasn't a dragon.
It Was a dinosaur!

48
00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:45.188
Living outside Was
a huge, fierce dinosaur!

49
00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.990
Rooooaaaarr!

50
00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.495
Rooooaaarr!

51
00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.327
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

52
00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.834
Oh, dear!
Maybe the dinosaur Wasn't

53
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.134
quite that fierce, Daddy Pig?

54
00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:02.078
Sorry, George. No, the dinosaur
Was very gentle.

55
00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:05.010
It ate lots of grass.

56
00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:11.454
Daddy Pig!

57
00:03:11.723 --> 00:03:14.419
Oh, sorry. I Was
being the dinosaur.

58
00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:21.428
Daddy, Why is the princess
called ''The Sleepy Princess''?

59
00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:26.160
I'm coming to that.
You see, the sun set.

60
00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.606
Then the stars and moon came out.

61
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.872
And everyone got very sleepy.

62
00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:42.681
But the most sleepy of all
Was the Sleepy Princess!

63
00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:48.625
Peppa? Are you sleepy?

64
00:03:49.394 --> 00:03:52.261
No, Daddy! I am not sleepy at all.

65
00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.398
But somebody is.

66
00:03:58.337 --> 00:03:59.895
George! Wake up!

67
00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:02.197
You'll miss the end of the story!

68
00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:04.902
Well, Peppa might not be sleepy,

69
00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:07.507
but the Sleepy Princess certainly Was.

70
00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.771
Looking at herself all day in the mirror

71
00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.281
had completely Worn her out.

72
00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:19.285
Let's carry you to bed. Goodnight!

73
00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:23.517
The Sleepy Princess Was so sleepy,

74
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.595
she had fallen fast asleep.

75
00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:35.099
Thank you for that story,
King Daddy!

76
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.374
You're Welcome,
Queen Mummy.

77
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.609
And our little prince and
princess enjoyed it, too!
