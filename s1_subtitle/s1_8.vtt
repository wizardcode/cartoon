00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:07.029
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.965
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.335
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.040
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.210
Camping!

5
00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.850
Peppa and her family are
going camping.

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.123
I love camping.
We're here.

7
00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.723
Hurray!

8
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.125
Peppa, George,

9
00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.729
this is the tent I had
When I Was a little boy!

10
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.002
Daddy? How are you going
to make that into a tent?

11
00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:43.867
Don't Worry, Peppa!
I'm an expert at camping!

12
00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.238
Mummy Pig, put the tent
on the poles, please.

13
00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.209
That's it!
Easy as pie!

14
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:51.743
Oh!

15
00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.576
Do these pegs do anything?

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.380
Of course!
I forgot about the pegs!

17
00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.581
The pegs hold the tent up.

18
00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:01.753
There!

19
00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.660
The tent is a bit little.

20
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.597
It Was big enough for me
When I Was a boy.

21
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.164
But it does look a bit small now...

22
00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.099
That's because you've grown a bit

23
00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.736
since you Were a boy, Daddy Pig!

24
00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.397
And your tummy has grown
the most of all!

25
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.669
Talking of tummies,

26
00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.478
We should cook supper!

27
00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.740
Yes! Yes!

28
00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.745
First, We have to collect
sticks to make a fire.

29
00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:26.983
Yipee!

30
00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.681
Peppa and George are
helping Daddy Pig

31
00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.254
collect sticks for the campfire.

32
00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.921
George, I'll pick up the sticks

33
00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.058
and you can carry them.

34
00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.626
Collecting sticks is fun!

35
00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.434
Good. That's enough sticks.

36
00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:51.208
That's a splendid campfire!
Now I'll light it.

37
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.433
Here are the matches.

38
00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.770
We don't need matches!

39
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.946
Daddy, how can you
light it Without matches?

40
00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.285
I'm going to make fire the old Way,

41
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.653
by simply rubbing these
two sticks together!

42
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.790
Daddy Pig is rubbing the
two sticks together

43
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:06.654
to light the campfire.

44
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.457
Where is the fire, Daddy?

45
00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:12.528
Nearly there...

46
00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:15.825
Hurray!

47
00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.530
Easy as pie!

48
00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.665
Now We can heat up
the tomato soup.

49
00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:27.110
Ahhh! Listen to the sounds
of nature!

50
00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.347
What is that sound?

51
00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.246
That is the sound
of crickets chirping.

52
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.046
What is that?

53
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.481
That's an owl.
Look! There it is!

54
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.182
Wow...

55
00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.762
And What's that noise?

56
00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:46.754
Oh, I'm not sure.

57
00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.192
It's Daddy's tummy!

58
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.197
My tummy rumbling is

59
00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.204
one of the best sounds of nature!

60
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.002
It means it's time to eat!

61
00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.704
I love tomato soup!

62
00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.068
So do I!

63
00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:07.011
There's another one of
Daddy Pig's sounds of nature!

64
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.851
Eh? What?

65
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.587
Come on, children,
into the tent,

66
00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:13.722
it's bedtime.

67
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.589
We Won't all fit in!
The tent is too little!

68
00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.088
It Will be fine!
ln you go!

69
00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.601
Move further in, Mummy Pig!

70
00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:28.167
Daddy, you're too big
for the tent!

71
00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:32.175
Never mind, I'd rather
sleep outside anyway.

72
00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:33.906
Goodnight, Daddy Pig!

73
00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:35.104
Goodnight, Daddy!

74
00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.042
Night! Night!

75
00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:38.548
Goodnight, everyone!

76
00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.414
Mummy Pig, Peppa and George
are sleeping in the tent.

77
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.755
Daddy Pig is sleeping
outside, under the stars.

78
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.618
Ahh! I love camping!

79
00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.125
Sleeping in the open air
With the stars above me!

80
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.922
Maybe this Wasn't such a
good idea after all...brrrrrr

81
00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.568
It is morning.

82
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.337
Daddy! It Was Iovely
and cozy in the tent!

83
00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.434
Oh... Where's Daddy?

84
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.137
Daddy Pig has gone!

85
00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:12.343
Poor Daddy Pig. He must
have been cold and Wet.

86
00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:13.778
And now Where is he?

87
00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.019
What's that sound?

88
00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.447
It sounds like snoring!

89
00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.462
Daddy Pig!

90
00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:27.458
What?

91
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.295
Daddy, you're safe!

92
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:31.959
Of course I'm safe!

93
00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.962
I'm an expert at camping!

94
00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:36.102
I slept in the car.

95
00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.533
Silly Daddy!

96
00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.740
I love camping!
