Today is the day of the school fete.

5
00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.856
Peppa loves coming to the fete.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.022
Here are Peppa's friends,
Candy Cat, Suzy Sheep,

7
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.720
Danny Dog, Rebecca Rabbit
and Pedro Pony.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.797
Hello, everyone!

9
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.530
Hello, Peppa!

10
00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.931
I love the school fete!

11
00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.795
Me, too! What do you like best?

12
00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:42.934
The face painting!

13
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.942
I like the balloons!

14
00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.741
I like the bouncy castle the best!

15
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.181
I like everything!

16
00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:56.320
A very good choice, Peppa!

17
00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.321

18
00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.052
See you later!

19
00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.752
George, What do you like best?

20
00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.560
Dine-Saw! Grrr!

21
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.898
Oh, dear, there aren't any dinosaurs
at the fete, George.

22
00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.627
Maybe We can get you a dinosaur balloon.

23
00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.898
Are you sure they have
dinosaur balloons,

24
00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:15.699
Daddy Pig?

25
00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.574
I'm certain of it.

26
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.073
Can George and I get our
faces painted first?

27
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.479
Of course.

28
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.409
Miss Rabbit has painted
Peppa's friends as tigers!

29
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.576
There you are, Suzy!

30
00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.580
Now you look like a tiger!

31
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.155
Thank you, Miss Rabbit!

32
00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.856
Wow! I like your face, Suzy.

33
00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.156
Are you a pussycat?

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.798
No! I'm a tiger!

35
00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.101
Peppa, Would you like
your face painted?

36
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.808
Yes, please.
Can I be an elephant?

37
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.608
Oh, dear, I don't know
how to do elephants.

38
00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.172
I can do tigers!

39
00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.509
Yes, a tiger, please!

40
00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.445
There you are, Peppa,

41
00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.017
now you're a tiger!

42
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.452
I'm a tiger!

43
00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.952
George, What Would you like to be?

44
00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.748
Dine-saw! Grr!

45
00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.258
A dinosaur?
Er, how about a tiger instead?

46
00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.130
I'm good at tigers.

47
00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.632
I'm a tiger!

48
00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.462
So am I! Woof! Woof!

49
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.637
Meow! Tigers don't say,
''Woof! Woof!''

50
00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.268
How do you know?

51
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.335
Because tigers are big cats.

52
00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.909
And I'm a cat!

53
00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.479
Candy, please, can you teach
us how to be tigers?

54
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:37.288
Okay! Tigers creep very, very slowly,

55
00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.354
and then, they jump! Grrrr!

56
00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.226
Tigers like to lick
themselves clean.

57
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.162
But, best of all, When tigers are happy...

58
00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.496
they purr.

59
00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.304
Hello, children. My goodness!

60
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.377
You're all tigers!

61
00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.513
And I'm teaching them
to be proper tigers. Grrr!

62
00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.949
What do you little tigers
Want to do next?

63
00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:11.883
Dine-Saw!

64
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.458
That's right! We have to find George
a dinosaur balloon!

65
00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.692
Let's get you all balloons!

66
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.398
Hurray!

67
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.460
Hello, Madame Gazelle!

68
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.398
We'd like some balloons, please.

69
00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.597
Certainly! I've got lots of different ones.

70
00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.899
Can I have an elephant
balloon? Please!

71
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.909
Here you are, Peppa!

72
00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:34.474
Can I have a kangaroo?

73
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:35.970
A lion, please!

74
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.774
A monkey, please!

75
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.109
A parrot, please!

76
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.983
Yes, I've got all those!

77
00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.345
Most important of all,

78
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.624
We need a dinosaur balloon for George.

79
00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.224
Oh, dear,

80
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.929
I do not seem to have
any dinosaur balloons.

81
00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.128
Oh.

82
00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.501
Don't Worry, George. I've got an idea.

83
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.301
Could We have two of the
long balloons, please?

84
00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:05.742
Watch this, everybody!

85
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.514
What is Daddy Pig doing
With the balloons?

86
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.385
There! Can anyone guess
What it is?

87
00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.246
ls it a kangaroo?

88
00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.314
No, it's a...

89
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.752
Dine-Saw!

90
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.755
That's right, a dinosaur!

91
00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.460
Daddy Pig has made a balloon dinosaur.

92
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.328
Grrrrrrrr! Dine-saw!

93
00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.662
Now, the bouncy castle!

94
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.402
Peppa loves bouncing
on the bouncy castle.

95
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.972
Everyone loves bouncing
