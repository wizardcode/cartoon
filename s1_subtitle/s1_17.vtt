00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:06.736
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.629
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.069
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.637
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.745
Picnic!

5
00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.023
It is a Iovely bright, sunny day.

6
00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.961
Peppa and her family are
going for a picnic!

7
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.087
Daddy Pig is bringing the
picnic basket.

8
00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:37.265
Picnic-blanket, bread, cheese,
tomatoes and lemonade.

9
00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.698
ls there anything We've forgotten?

10
00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.696
Mummy's strawberry cake!

11
00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:44.272
I Was just teasing!

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.770
Mummy's home-made
strawberry cake is there, too.

13
00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.676
ls everybody ready?

14
00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:50.678
Ready!

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.415
Then let's go!

16
00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.558
This looks like just the
spot for our picnic!

17
00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:04.788
Hurray!

18
00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.195
It's great to be outdoors!

19
00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:12.426
We should run around a bit and get

20
00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:13.434
some exercise!

21
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.372
I Want to eat, then
have a nap.

22
00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.440
I certainly don't Want to run around.

23
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.941
Maybe Daddy should run around a bit.

24
00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:22.942
His tummy is quite big.

25
00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:24.809
My tummy is not big.

26
00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:27.212
But later, I Will get some exercise,

27
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.150
even if no one else does.

28
00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:31.315
Let's eat!

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.457
Good idea, Mummy Pig!
I'm really hungry!

30
00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.725
Hmmm... delicious!

31
00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.464
Ahhhhh! I feel quite sleepy!

32
00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.739
I thought you Wanted to run
around a bit, Daddy Pig?

33
00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:51.606
Later...

34
00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.480
Look! There's a little duck pond!

35
00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:03.120
Mummy, can We feed the ducks?

36
00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.113
Yes, you can feed them the
rest of the bread.

37
00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:12.260
Peppa and George love
feeding bread to ducks.

38
00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:20.496
Mummy, I think
they Want some more.

39
00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.204
That Was the last of the bread.

40
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.006
I'm sure they've had enough.

41
00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:28.371
Sorry, Mrs. Duck,
We've no more bread.

42
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.641
The ducks Want more food.

43
00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.586
So much for Daddy Pig and his exercise!

44
00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.652
Eh? What?

45
00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:45.020
You lot again!

46
00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:47.827
Peppa told you;
there's no more bread!

47
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.831
Mummy, We do have
strawberry cake!

48
00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:54.396
Well, if there's any cake left over,

49
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.598
you can give it to the ducks.

50
00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.541
Everyone likes Mummy Pig's

51
00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.304
home-made strawberry cake!

52
00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:01.905
Eeek! A Wasp!

53
00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.411
I hate Wasps! Shooooo!

54
00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.413
What a fuss, Mummy Pig!

55
00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.243
It's only a little Wasp!

56
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.318
Go away, Wasp!

57
00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.922
Just stay still, Mummy Pig.

58
00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:13.251
Then it Will fly away.

59
00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:18.424
There! You see,
all you had to do is stay still!

60
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:20.693
Eh! Get away!

61
00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:25.131
Scram! Whoa...
Help! Whooooaaa!

62
00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.264
Shhooo! Get it off me!
Whoooa! Arrgh!

63
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.200
I hope the Wasp
doesn't sting Daddy.

64
00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:34.436
Whooa! Get away, you little pest!

65
00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:36.340
No, Daddy is running too fast

66
00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:37.847
for the Wasp to catch him.

67
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.008
Whoooa! Arrgh! Shooo!

68
00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.709
Let's eat our cake

69
00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.344
before the Wasp comes back.

70
00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.591
Oh, no! We forgot to leave
any for the ducks!

71
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.228
I think I lost it!

72
00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.403
You said you Would run around
and get some exercise,

73
00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.730
Daddy Pig! But I didn't
believe you'd do it!

74
00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:09.976
Luckily, I managed to hang on
to my slice of strawberry cake!

75
00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:11.878
Stop, Daddy!

76
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.412
We promised the rest of the cake
for the ducks!

77
00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:15.811
Oh.

78
00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:18.889
You are very lucky ducks.

79
00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:23.485
Say ''thank you'' to Daddy Pig.

80
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:27.121
You're most Welcome.

81
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.902
It's time to go home.
Say goodbye to the ducks.

82
00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.434
Bye bye, ducks.

83
00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:36.838
See you next time!

84
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:07.199
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
