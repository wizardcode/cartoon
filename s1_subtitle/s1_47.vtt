00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:07.031
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:08.764
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.168
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:14.701
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:22.050
Daddy Puts up a Picture!

5
00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:26.485
Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig

6
00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:28.685
have a new picture of
Peppa and George.

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.351
We should put this Iovely,
new picture on the Wall.

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.356
Leave it to me.

9
00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:36.427
I am the Dly expert of the house.

10
00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.493
Are you sure you can do it?

11
00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:41.739
Of course! I'll just put
a nail in the Wall

12
00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:42.862
and hang the picture on it.

13
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.936
Very good. I'm just off

14
00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:46.704
to visit Granny and Grandpa Pig.

15
00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:52.507
I'll see you later.
And please, don't make a mess.

16
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.585
Mess?

17
00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:56.877
Goodbye. Goodbye.

18
00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.883
Daddy, can We help
put up the picture?

19
00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:04.827
You can Watch

20
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.327
and then you'll learn
how to do it properly.

21
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:13.462
First, I need a tape measure.
And a pencil.

22
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.908
That is Where I'm
going to put the nail.

23
00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:23.246
Don't break the Wall, Daddy.

24
00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.911
Now I need a hammer and a nail.

25
00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:29.912
Stand back, children,

26
00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:31.416
and Watch a craftsman at Work.

27
00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.058
Daddy Pig is going to knock
the nail into the Wall.

28
00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:38.425
Don't break the Wall, Daddy.

29
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:41.296
Don't be silly, Peppa.

30
00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:45.428
Easy as pie.

31
00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:49.063
Oh, it's not meant to do that.

32
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.807
Daddy Pig has made
a big crack in the Wall.

33
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.070
Oh, Daddy! You've
broken the Wall.

34
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.072
It's just a tiny crack. The
picture Will hide it.

35
00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:00.780
There!

36
00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.583
I can still see the crack, Daddy.

37
00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:06.450
Yes, I'll just take the nail out

38
00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:07.522
and fill in the crack.

39
00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.384
Don't make a mess, Daddy.

40
00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:11.786
Don't be silly, Peppa.

41
00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:14.291
It's coming out.

42
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:15.955
WOOAh!

43
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.028
Oh, Daddy!

44
00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.466
Now you really have
broken the Wall.

45
00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.974
Do you think Mummy
Will notice?

46
00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.674
Er... Yes, I think she might.

47
00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:33.348
Quick, George!

48
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.845
What are they doing?

49
00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.988
Daddy, We can see you.

50
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.190
Hmmmm.

51
00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.627
Daddy Pig has to mend the Wall
before Mummy Pig comes home.

52
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:50.859
Brick, please.

53
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.863
First, Daddy Pig fills
the hole With bricks.

54
00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:06.646
There.

55
00:03:09.387 --> 00:03:12.356
Next, Daddy Pig puts
plaster over the bricks.

56
00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:16.583
Easy as pie!

57
00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:19.721
Then Daddy Pig paints the Wall.

58
00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:27.594
Good as new!

59
00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:28.901
The Wall is mended.

60
00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:29.970
Hurray!

61
00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:33.537
But look at all the mess
they have made.

62
00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.470
Goodness me!

63
00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.173
We had better clean up
before Mummy comes back.

64
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.110
First, Daddy Pig quickly
Washes Peppa and George.

65
00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:42.913
Then peppa vacuums the floor.

66
00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:45.682
And Daddy Pig tidies up the tools.

67
00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:49.622
Mummy!

68
00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:51.259
Mummy Pig is home.

69
00:03:53.498 --> 00:03:54.055
Mummy!

70
00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:55.498
Mummy's here!

71
00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.894
Quick! Pretend nothing has happened.

72
00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:01.201
Hello.

73
00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:02.437
Hello.

74
00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:04.906
What have you been doing?

75
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.575
Oh, nothing.

76
00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:12.144
Yes. I can see you've
been doing nothing.

77
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.716
I thought you Were going
to put the picture up.

78
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.911
ln all the excitement, Daddy Pig
has forgotten to put the picture up.

79
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.449
Oh!

80
00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:23.794
Well, I'm no expert, but
I'm sure it's quite easy.

81
00:04:27.732 --> 00:04:28.460
There!

82
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.098
Hmmm... yes, that did look quite easy.

83
00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.027
But When you did it, Daddy,

84
00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:34.432
it looked really hard.

85
00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:37.172
Shhhhh! Peppa, don't tell anyone!
