00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:06.595
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.465
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.801
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.245
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.242
At the Beach!

5
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.181
Peppa and her family
are going to the beach.

6
00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.751
Peppa and George love
going to the beach.

7
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.423
What a lot of stuff!

8
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.757
We must be careful not to
forget anything When We go.

9
00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.700
Sunshade, beach-bag,
towels,

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.075
buckets and spades,
and a spotty ball.

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.207
Good. Now,
before you start playing,

12
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.006
you need some sun cream on.

13
00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:51.580
The sun is very hot,

14
00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.778
so Peppa and George have
to have sun cream on.

15
00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.356
Let's try out this spotty ball!

16
00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.414
It seems to Work.

17
00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.525
What a great spotty ball!

18
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.968
George, you throw the ball
and I Will catch it!

19
00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.672
George! Catch!

20
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.108
Oh, dear. George is too little
to catch the ball.

21
00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.247
Never mind, George.

22
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.241
Would you and Peppa like to
have a paddle in the sea?

23
00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.817
Yes, please, Daddy!

24
00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.889
Let's put your
Water-Wings on.

25
00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:40.328
There We go. You look very smart
in your Water-Wings, George.

26
00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.265
My turn! My turn!

27
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.466
Good.

28
00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.132
Now We can play in the Water.

29
00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.141
Hurray!

30
00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.278
ls the Water cold?

31
00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.850
It's Iovely and Warm!

32
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:02.510
Aaaah!

33
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.786
Whaaoo!

34
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.493
Steady on!

35
00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.529
You started it, Daddy Pig!

36
00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.034
Woah! Maybe that's
enough splashing.

37
00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:25.442
Wheee! Daddy,
I love being at the beach.

38
00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.677
Peppa and George love the beach.

39
00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.672
Everyone loves the beach.

40
00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.738
Peppa, George,

41
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.109
Would you like to play With
your buckets and spades?

42
00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.512
Yes, please, Mummy!

43
00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:39.690
Daddy! Daddy!

44
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.184
Can We bury you in sand?

45
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.060
Err... Well...

46
00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.960
Please, Daddy!

47
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.530
Oh, alright!

48
00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.392
Yippee!

49
00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.906
Peppa and George are
burying Daddy Pig in the sand!

50
00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.204
Steady on!

51
00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:01.908
There!

52
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.072
Now you can't escape!

53
00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:05.978
My head is getting a bit hot.

54
00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.647
Can I have my straw hat?

55
00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.482
Well... if you say ''please''.

56
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.586
Please, can I have
my straw hat?

57
00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.416
Yes, you may, Daddy.

58
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:23.601
That's nice. Maybe I'll
just have a little sleep...

59
00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.668
George, let's make sand castles!

60
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.601
Peppa and George
are making sand castles!

61
00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:37.378
First, We put sand in the buckets.
Like this.

62
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.588
We turn the buckets upside down

63
00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.686
and tap them...

64
00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:47.392
And lift the bucket up!
Hey, presto!

65
00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.116
A sandcastle!

66
00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.127
Hey, presto!

67
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.620
Another sand castle!

68
00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.900
Peppa, George, home time!

69
00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.700
Don't leave any stuff behind.

70
00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.401
Let's check that We haven't
forgotten anything...

71
00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:07.040
Towels, beach-bag, sunshade,
and the spotty ball.

72
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.538
That's everything!

73
00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:10.907
I'm sure We've
forgotten something...

74
00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.118
Of course!
We forgot the hat!

75
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.555
Daddy! We forgot Daddy!

76
00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.564
Yes, We forgot Daddy Pig!

77
00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.561
Eh? What?

78
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.364
Daddy, We almost left you behind!

79
00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:33.937
But George remembered you.

80
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.008
Well, I'm glad
George remembered me!

81
00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:06.728
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

82
00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.665
This is Mummy Pig.

83
00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.000
And this is Daddy Pig.

84
00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.435
Peppa pig.

85
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.945
Mister Skinnylegs!

86
00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:25.454
Peppa is playing With her doll's house.
George is playing, too.

87
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.893
Peppa is making a tea party
for the doll family.

88
00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.688
Here, George! I'm the Mummy and Daddy.

89
00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.263
You can be the children.
