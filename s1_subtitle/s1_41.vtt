00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:07.171
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:09.005
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:11.441
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.008
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.743
Shopping!

5
00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.588
Peppa and George are
going shopping!

6
00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:30.957
Peppa and George like shopping.

7
00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.028
George loves
sitting in the trolley.

8
00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:38.969
So does Peppa.

9
00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:42.037
Daddy, can I sit
in the trolley, too?

10
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.105
You're too big
for the trolley, Peppa.

11
00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:46.273
Oh!

12
00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.212
But you can help
With the shopping.

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.276
Oh, goody!

14
00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.782
We've got four things on the list.

15
00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.783
Tomatoes, spaghetti,
onions and fruit.

16
00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:58.116
I'll find it all!

17
00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:03.790
This Way!

18
00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:07.561
Peppa and George love shopping.

19
00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.226
Peppa, first, We need tomatoes.

20
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.063
Hmmmm! I can see them!

21
00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.566
Here are the tomatoes, Mummy.

22
00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:20.941
Well done, Peppa!

23
00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:25.649
One, two, three, four.

24
00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:27.508
Now, put them in the trolley.

25
00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:31.315
I found the tomatoes!

26
00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:35.021
Well done, Peppa. Tomatoes,

27
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.160
that's one thing off the list.

28
00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:39.158

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.391
Pi-getty!

31
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.659
That's right, George,

32
00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.027
but it's called spa-ghe-tti.

33
00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.396
Pi-getty!

34
00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:50.669
Spaghetti is Peppa and
George's favorite food.

35
00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:52.601
I Wonder Where the spaghetti is?

36
00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.836

37
00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:59.239

We have plenty of crisps at home,
Peppa.

47
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.072
Have another guess.

48
00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.704
Hmmm. I just can't remember.

dinosaurs in the supermarket!

53
00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:45.454
No, George. The next thing
