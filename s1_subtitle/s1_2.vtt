00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:06.328
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.466
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.903
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.068
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.353
Mr. Dinosaur is Lost.

5
00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.291
George's favourite toy
is Mr. Dinosaur.

6
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.724
Dinedine Sawsaw.

7
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.095
George loves Mr. Dinosaur.

8
00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.298
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr..

9
00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.368
Sometimes, George likes

10
00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.030
to scare Peppa with
Mr. Dinosaur.

11
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.003
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

12
00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.735
Eeek. Too scary.

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.246
At suppertime,

14
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.542
Mr. Dinosaur sits next to George.

15
00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.244
I beg your pardon.

16
00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.623
Was that you George,
or was it Mr. Dinosaur?

17
00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.125
Dinedine Sawsaw.

18
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:06.693
At bath time,

19
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.024
George shares his bath
with Mr. Dinosaur.

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.532
Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.130
Goodnight, Peppa.

22
00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.397
Goodnight, Mummy.

23
00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.403
Goodnight, George.

24
00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.478
And goodnight, Mr. Dinosaur.

25
00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.642
Grrrrrrrrr.

26
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.780
When George goes to bed,

27
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.484
Mr. Dinosaur is tucked up with him.

28
00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.049
George's favourite game is

29
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.422
throwing Mr. Dinosaur
up in the air...

30
00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:36.584
Wheeeeeee.

31
00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.854
...and Catching him
when he falls back down.

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.789
Wheeeeeeeee.

33
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.169
Peppa and Daddy Pig are
playing draughts.

34
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.301
I win, Daddy.

35
00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:56.111
Oh, welldine Sawdone, Peppa.

36
00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.079
Whhhhaaaaaaaaaaa.

37
00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.674
George?

38
00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.680
Whaaaaaaaaa.

39
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.516
George, what's the matter?

40
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.817
Dinedine Sawsaw...

41
00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.389
George, have you
lost Mr. Dinosaur?

42
00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.597
George has lost
Mr. Dinosaur.

43
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.758
Don't worry George.

44
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.458
We'll find Mr. Dinosaur.

45
00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.898
It's a job for a detective.

46
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.608
Daddy, what is a dedine SawteChdine Sawtiff?

47
00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.473
A detective is
a very important person

48
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.045
who is good at finding things.

49
00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.617
Me. Me. I'm good at
finding things.

50
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.483
Alright. Peppa is the detective.

51
00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.355
George. I am the dedine SawteChdine Sawtiff.

52
00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.654
I will help you find Mr. Dinosaur.

53
00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:44.989
Maybe the detective should ask

54
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.224
George some simple questions.

55
00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:51.234
George? Where's Mr. Dinosaur?

56
00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.001
Whaaaaaaaaaa.

57
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.640
George does not know
where Mr. Dinosaur is.

58
00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:58.005
The detective Could try and guess

59
00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.510
where Mr. Dinosaur might be.

60
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.440
I know. I know where he is.

61
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.887
George always has Mr. Dinosaur
with him in the bath.

62
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.015
So Mr. Dinosaur is in the bath.

63
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.656
Mr. Dinosaur is not in the bath.

64
00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.754
Oh. I know.

65
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.956
I know where Mr. Dinosaur is.

66
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.469
George always has Mr.
Dinosaur in his bed at night.

67
00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.338
So that's where he is.

68
00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.210
Mr. Dinosaur is not in George's bed.

69
00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.037
Oh.

70
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.907
Maybe we should try the garden.

71
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.907
Yes, the garden.

72
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.280
I was going to say that.

73
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.288
Where is Mr. Dinosaur?

74
00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.057
Mr. Dinosaur is
very hard to find.

75
00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:54.556
Oh. Mr. Dinosaur
isn't anywhere.

76
00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:59.695
George? You do love to throw
Mr. Dinosaur in the air...

77
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.430
I wonder if this time

78
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.805
you threw Mr. Dinosaur
just a bit too high.

79
00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.440
There he is. There he is.

80
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.014
I saw him first.

81
00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.251
Welldine Sawdone, Peppa.

82
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.720
You really are a
very good detective.

83
00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:22.821
Dinedine Sawsaw.

84
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.455
Grrrrrrrrrr.

85
00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.465
George is so happy to have
Mr. Dinosaur back again.

86
00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.728
Wheeeeeeeeee.

87
00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.962
Maybe it isn't a good idea

88
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.474
to play with dinosaurs near trees.

89
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.478
Dinedine Sawsaw.
