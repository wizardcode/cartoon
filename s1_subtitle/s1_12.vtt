I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.

1
00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.701
This is Mummy Pig.

2
00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.073
And this is Daddy Pig.

3
00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.573
Peppa pig.

4
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.714
Snow

5
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.094
Peppa and George are very excited today.

6
00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.153
It is snowing outside!

7
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.159
Mummy! Can We go and play in the snow?

8
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.795
Yes, but it's very cold outside,

9
00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.593
so you must Wrap up Warm.

10
00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:39.727
Hurray!

11
00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:41.935
And don't forget to Wear your hats,

12
00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:44.033
and scarves and gloves.

13
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.539
It is very cold outside.

14
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.474
Peppa and George must Wear their hats...

15
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.114
and scarves... and gloves.

16
00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.952
Come on, George!

17
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.457
Peppa and George are making
footprints in the snow.

18
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.327
Peppa and George love making
footprints in the snow!

19
00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:17.468
Oops!

20
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.772
Oh, dear

21
00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.279
It's not funny!

22
00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.219
George, let's play snowballs!

23
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.293
Peppa has made a snowball.

24
00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.748
Peppa and George are having a lot of fun.

25
00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.313
George, come back, you little piggy!

26
00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:04.812
Arrgh!

27
00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:27.135
Oh, dear. Maybe this game is
getting a little too rough.

28
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.077
Sorry, George.

29
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.578
George! Let's build a snowman!

30
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.424
Peppa and George are making a snowman.

31
00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.218
First, they make the body.

32
00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:44.654
George, this is the snowman's body.

33
00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.857
Now, they make the snowman's head.

34
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.369
Now, he needs arms
and eyes and a mouth!

35
00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.879
George has found some sticks
for the snowman's arms.

36
00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.379
Peppa has found some stones
for the snowman's eyes and mouth.

37
00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.443
This is his face.

38
00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.882
Now the snowman needs a nose.

39
00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.253
Peppa has got a carrot,
to make the snowman's nose.

40
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.458
The snowman looks very happy.

41
00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.635
But maybe he is bit cold.

42
00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.106
The snowman needs some clothes
to keep him Warm.

43
00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.405
George has found some clothes

44
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.276
to keep the snowman nice and Warm!

45
00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:46.616
The snowman is Wearing his hat... and
scarf... and gloves.

46
00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.986
Mummy! Daddy! Come and look!

47
00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.129
Mummy Pig is Wearing her hat
and scarf and gloves.

48
00:03:56.802 --> 00:04:00.738
That is the best snowman
I have ever seen!

49
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.301
Daddy Pig looks quite cold.

50
00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:10.441
He isn't Wearing his hat
and scarf and gloves.

51
00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.948
Daddy, Why aren't you
Wearing your hat

52
00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.020
and scarf and gloves?

53
00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:20.019
I don't know Where they are!

54
00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.951
I can't find them anywhere.

55
00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:26.461
I think I know Where
Daddy's hat, scarf and gloves are...

56
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.259
Daddy Pig's hat and scarf and gloves

57
00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.460
are on the snowman!

58
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.032
Oh!

59
00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:07.064
I'm Peppa Pig.
This is my little brother, George.
