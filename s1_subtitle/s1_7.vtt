00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.736
And this is Daddy Pig.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.746
Mummy Pig at Work

5
00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.758
Mummy Pig is
Working on her computer.

6
00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.903
Daddy Pig is making soup for lunch.

7
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:44.133
Daddy? Can We go and Watch
Mummy on her computer?

8
00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.137
Yes, as long as
you don't disturb her.

9
00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.842
She has a lot of
important Work to do today.

10
00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.274
Thank you, Daddy!

11
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.952
Mummy Pig has a lot of
important Work to do.

12
00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.159
Mummy. Can George and I

13
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.663
sit on your lap and Watch you Work?

14
00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.166
Yes, if you both sit quietly.

15
00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.662
Peppa and George love to

16
00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:14.865
Watch Mummy Work on the computer.

17
00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.036
Mummy? Can We play
that computer game,

18
00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.305
''Happy Mrs. Chicken''?

19
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.814
We can play
''Happy Mrs. Chicken'' later.

20
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.314
But now I have to Work.

21
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.743
Mummy? Can We help you Work?

22
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.390
No, Peppa! You mustn't
touch the computer.

23
00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.483
And George, you mustn't

24
00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.491
touch the computer, either.

25
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.756
Yes, George. You mustn't do this.

26
00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.892
Peppa, stop!

27
00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.194
Sorry, Mummy.

28
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.564
I Was just showing George
What not to do.

29
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.410
Oh, dear. The computer
is not meant to do that.

30
00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:54.843
Daddy Pig!

31
00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.778
Daddy Pig!!

32
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.511
What is it, Mummy Pig?

33
00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.484
Daddy Pig, can you mend the computer?

34
00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:06.855
Err...

35
00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.516
I'll finish the lunch

36
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:09.921
While you mend the computer.

37
00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.927
Err... Right. you are, Mummy Pig,

38
00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.292
but I'm not very good
With these things...

39
00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.163
Oh, thank you, Daddy Pig!

40
00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.996
Daddy Pig is going
to mend the computer!

41
00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.503
Hmm.

42
00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.173
Hmmm.
Hmm.

43
00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.879
Um. Maybe if I just switch if off...

44
00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.320
And then switch it on again...

45
00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.893
Daddy Pig has mended the computer!

46
00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.626
Hurray, Daddy!

47
00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.065
Yes, I am a bit of
an expert at these things.

48
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.573
Daddy? Can We play that computer
game, ''Happy Mrs. Chicken?''

49
00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.573
Maybe you should ask Mummy Pig.

50
00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.280
Mummy said that We could play it later.

51
00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:04.909
Well, that's okay, then.

52
00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.577
But I don't know Where the disc is.

53
00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.599
Yippeeee!

54
00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.176
Now, it's my turn!

55
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.188
Now, it's my turn!

56
00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.648
What on earth is going on?

57
00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:22.718
Well, I see that the computer
is Working again.

58
00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:06.428
I'm Peppa Pig. This
is my little brother, George.
