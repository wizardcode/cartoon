00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:18.612
Horsey Twinkle Toes

7
00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:22.657
Peppa and George are playing in their bedroom. 

8
00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:25.327
Dinosaur! Grr.

9
00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:29.347
George, you must stay on your side of the bedroom. 

10
00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:35.147
That's your side and this is my side.

11
00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:38.227
 Do not cross the invisible line. 

12
00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:40.257
Post!

13
00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:45.937
Hello, Mr. Zebra!

14
00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:49.817
Hello, Daddy Pig! 
I've got some letters for you. 

15
00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.377
Is there anything for me and George?

16
00:00:52.477 --> 00:00:56.757
Mmm…I'm afraid not. 
They are all for Mummy and me. 

17
00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:57.807
Oh.

18
00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:59.827
There's a parcel as well. 

19
00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:03.367
Probably that box of reinforced concrete I ordered.  

20
00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.697
Look at all the stamps on it. 

21
00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:09.527
That's because it's from a long way away. 

22
00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:10.847
Bye now. 

23
00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:11.947
Bye-bye. 

24
00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:15.787
Oh, the label says it is for Peppa and George. 

25
00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:17.187
Yippee!

26
00:01:18.457 --> 00:01:21.887
Look, Mummy. A parcel for George and me. 

27
00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:22.567
Oh.

28
00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.157
There's a letter too. 

29
00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:26.677
Dear Peppa and George, 

30
00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:28.917
Here's a present for you to share. 

31
00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:30.927
Love from your Aunty Dottie!

32
00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:34.547
Aunty Dottie lives far away,
 in another country. 

33
00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:37.187
Woo! What is the present?

34
00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:40.007
It's got wheels. 

35
00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:41.147
Car. 

36
00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:46.297
It's not a car, George. 
It's got legs. It's a table. 

37
00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:50.127
It's got a tail. 

38
00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.517
Oh, tables don't have tails.

39
00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:55.237
There's a handle as well. 

40
00:01:55.337 --> 00:01:58.107
What can it be?

41
00:01:58.207 --> 00:02:01.357
There's something else in the box. 

42
00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:04.607
It's a toy horse.

43
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:08.117
I shall call it "Twinkle Toes".

44
00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.531
Horsey! Twinkle Toes! 

45
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:13.181
Horsey! Twinkle Toes! Horsey!

46
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:17.651
Remember children, 
Aunt Dottie sent the present for both of you. 

47
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.991
You have to share. Sharing can be fun. 

48
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:23.661
Can I play with Twinkle Toes first?

49
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:27.321
Let George have the first turn.
 He's the youngest. 

50
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:29.991
Horsey! Horsey! 

51
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.791
George likes playing with Horsey! 

52
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:36.691
George, it is called Twinkle Toes, not Horsey. 

53
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:38.721
Now, it's Peppa's turn. 

54
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:45.231
I'm Princess Peppa, 
with my magic horse Twinkle Toes. 

55
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.071
Peppa likes playing with Twinkle Toes! 

56
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:50.131
Oops!

57
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.171
Perhaps you should play with the toy horse outside. 

58
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:55.431
Yes, Mummy. 

59
00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:00.491
Mmm, it's a bit steep here.

60
00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:02.771
Maybe you should play at the bottom of the hill.

61
00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:06.891
And the quickest way down the hill
 is to ride down. 

62
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:13.011
Are your sure, Daddy? 
Don't crash like you always do. 

63
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:18.101
Oh-uh, I know what I'm doing, Peppa.
 I'm a grown-up. 

64
00:03:19.753 --> 00:03:22.743
How are you going to stop, Daddy?

65
00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:25.544
I don't know.

66
00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:29.944
Where are the brakes? 

67
00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:39.094
Clever, Daddy. You used the duck pond to stop. 

68
00:03:40.444 --> 00:03:42.514
What was that big splash?

69
00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:44.054
What big splash?

70
00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:47.614
Daddy Pig, 
did you know you've got a duck on your head? 

71
00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:52.094
Oh, err…yes, well, 
I did fall into the pond. 

72
00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:56.544
Horsey! Horsey! 

73
00:03:56.844 --> 00:03:59.204
George wants to ride on the toy horse.  

74
00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:00.984
Go! Go! 

75
00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:02.684
Oh!

76
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.274
George cannot make the horse go. 

77
00:04:05.374 --> 00:04:10.584
If only there was some one big and strong
 to push George along. 

78
00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:14.324
I'm big and strong. I can push George. 

79
00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:16.294
What a good idea, Peppa!

80
00:04:19.414 --> 00:04:21.194
Horsey! Horsey! 

81
00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:24.424
George, she's called Twinkle Toe. 

82
00:04:24.524 --> 00:04:25.494
Horsey!

83
00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:26.844
Twinkle Toe!

84
00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:28.054
Horsey!

85
00:04:29.114 --> 00:04:37.094
I know. Because the present is for both of us.
 We'll call her Horsey Twinkle Toes!

86
00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:44.024
Peppa and George love playing together,
 with Horsey Twinkle Toes.
