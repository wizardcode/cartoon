00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:18.214
The Noisy Night

7
00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:22.724
Peppa's family are having a sleepover
 at Cousin Chloé's house. 

8
00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:23.650
Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:24.884
Hello.

10
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.710
You must be tired after a long journey. 

11
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.330
Yes. An early night would be nice. 

12
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.610
First, we'll put baby Alexander to bed. 

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.420
This is baby Alexander's bedroom 

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.290
Alexander likes noise. It sends him to sleep. 

15
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
We like noise in this house. 

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.430
We're a noisy family. 

17
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.110
Peppa, George, you're staying in my room tonight. 

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.520
Oh, goodie. 

19
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.410
Peppa and George are excited 
to be sleeping in Cousin Chloé's bedroom. 

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.070
Good night!

21
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.920
Good night!

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.900
Good night!

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.940
Good night!

24
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.250
Good night!

25
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870
Night-night. 

26
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.370
Everyone is tucked up in their beds. Asleep!

27
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.250
Baby Alexander is awake. 

28
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.920
Peppa and George are awake.

29
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.820
What's that noise?

30
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.200
It's the vacuum cleaner. 

31
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.750
Erm…why are you vacuuming at night?

32
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.150
We are not disturbing you, are we?

33
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.110
What? Oh, no!

34
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.140
We found noise is the best way
 to get baby Alexander back to sleep.

35
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.500
 He likes noise. 

36
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.130
We're a noisy family. 

37
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.670
Everyone is back in their beds. Asleep!

38
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.290
Baby Alexander is awake. 

39
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.240
Why is Aunty Pig playing a trumpet?

40
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.530
To get Alexander to sleep. 
The more noise, the better. 

41
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.780
Is there another way that doesn't use noise?

42
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.910
We do find noise is the best way. 

43
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.780
When George was a baby, 

44
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.590
we used to put him in his pram
 and wheel him around the house. 

45
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.200
And that always sent him to sleep. 

46
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.000
How strange!

47
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.790
No loud noises? 

48
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.120
That's right. 

49
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.770
How many times around the house was it,
 Mummy pig?

50
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.920
Three time?

51
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.980
Fifty times. 

52
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.090
Daddy Pig is pushing baby Alexander
 around the house, fifty times. 

53
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.720
Good, baby Alexander is asleep. 

54
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.170
Can you let me back in?

55
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.550
I'll just switch the alarm. 

56
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.680
Switch the alarm back on. 

57
00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:12.970
Peppa, what are you doing up?

58
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.960
I can't sleep, Daddy. It's a noisy night. 

59
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.500
OK, Peppa. Let's get you back to bed. 

60
00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:26.730
Now, which bedroom are you staying in?

61
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.490
Stop, Daddy. That's baby Alexander's room. 

62
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.230
Ah!

63
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.690
The light has woken baby Alexander. 

64
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.540
That's all right. I've got the vacuum cleaner. 

65
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.750
I've got the trumpet. 

66
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.880
Stop! Stop! I remember another quiet way
 we used to get George to sleep. 

67
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.750
Oh, yes. We drove him around in the car. 

68
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.070
I'll get the car started. 

69
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.600
Don't forget the alarm!

70
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.140
Daddy Pig has set off the noisy house alarm. 

71
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.820
The noisy house has woken everyone up. 

72
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.100
It's Miss Rabbit in her rescue helicopter. 

73
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.280
Is everybody all right, stand-by?
 I have the alarm. 

74
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.350
Yes, thank you. 

75
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.950
All right, cheerio. 

76
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.160
All that loud noise 
has sent baby Alexander to sleep. 

77
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.600
He's really fast asleep now. 

78
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.850
All thanks to my noisy daddy. 

79
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.070
Well done, Daddy Pig.


80
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.070
We should have you to stay more often.
