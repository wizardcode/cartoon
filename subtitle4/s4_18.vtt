1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.055
Lost Keys

7
00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:22.605
Peppa and her family have been 
for a lovely day out in the mountains. 

8
00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:25.305
Time to go home. Back to the car. 

9
00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:30.475
Thank you for visiting the Mountain Beauty Spot.
 See you again soon. 

10
00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.875
Key! Key!

11
00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:38.535
No, George. You can't play with the car keys.
 You might lose them. 

12
00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:42.895
You're playing with the car keys, Daddy. 

13
00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:46.615
But I'm a grown-up. I'm not going to lose them. 

14
00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:51.825
Oh dear. 
Daddy Pig has dropped the car keys down a drain. 

15
00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:52.755
Oh!

16
00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:55.295
Right! Let's go home.

17
00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:58.325
Erm…that might be difficult. 

18
00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.355
Why?

19
00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.505
Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain. 

20
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:05.235
Oh, Daddy Pig!

21
00:01:05.335 --> 00:01:09.465
Don't worry. 
I'll get the car keys out of the drain with a stick. 

22
00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:10.665
Hooray!

23
00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:14.795
Mmm…the drain must be deeper than I thought. 

24
00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:18.105
The stick is not long enough to reach the keys. 

25
00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:21.095
What we need is a fishing rod.

26
00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:23.575
Then we can catch the keys on a hook.

27
00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.225
Maybe Miss Rabbit sells fishing rods. 

28
00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:29.265
Erm…do you sell fishing rods. 

29
00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:32.355
We do, actually. I don't know why.

30
00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:34.695
You don't get fish in the mountains. 

31
00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.735
We are not fishing for fish. 
We are fishing for keys. 

32
00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:41.635
My Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain. 

33
00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:46.155
Oh, you'll never get those back.
 That drain's really deep. 

34
00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.155
What are drains for?

35
00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:52.045
A drain takes the rain water away to the sea. 

36
00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.175
The fishing line is not long enough to reach the keys. 

37
00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:02.885
My goodness! How deep is this drain?

38
00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:06.275
We can see how deep it is by dropping a stone. 

39
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.045
Good idea, Miss Rabbit. 

40
00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:12.245
We can count how long the stone takes to reach the bottom. 

41
00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:20.645
One, two, three, four, five, six. 

42
00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:23.005
That, is deep!

43
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:23.935
Told you!

44
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.575
What can we do now?

45
00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:28.675
It is Mr. Bull and his friends. 

46
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:30.865
Digger! Train!

47
00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.265
George loves diggers and trains. 

48
00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.005
Hello, everybody. 

49
00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:39.335
Hello, Mr. Bull. 
Welcome to the Mountain Beauty Spot.

50
00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.195
Have you come to do some work?

51
00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:46.815
No, it's our day off. 
So we came to enjoy the Beauty Spot. 

52
00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:49.145
You can see for miles, boss.

53
00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:50.955
Yes, it's very pretty. 

54
00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:56.425
Erm…Mr. Bull, could we borrow your crane for a minute?

55
00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:57.335
What for?

56
00:02:57.435 --> 00:03:01.235
My Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain. 

57
00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:07.625
Say no more. I left over in no time. 

58
00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:07.674
Mr. Rhino, the crane please. 

59
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:12.843
Stand clear. Down she goes!

60
00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:16.407
How lucky Mr. Bull came along when he did!

61
00:03:16.507 --> 00:03:19.587
Yes, now we'll finally get our keys back. 

62
00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:24.497
That's the furthest she goes, chief. 

63
00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.417
Mr. Bull is the chief. 

64
00:03:26.517 --> 00:03:28.627
Did you find our keys?

65
00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:32.447
No. The crane isn't long enough. 

66
00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:33.977
Now, what shall we do?

67
00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:37.887
Easy! We'll dig up the road. 

68
00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:39.197
Hooray!

69
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.560
Mr. Bull is digging up the beauty spot. 

70
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.880
Stop!

71
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.960
What's going on? 

72
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.750
We came to see the beauty spot. 

73
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.730
Erm…they're digging it up now. Won't be long. 

74
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.530
My Daddy dropped the car keys down the drain. 

75
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.730
Oh!

76
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.080
Hold it! Hold it!

77
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.240
It's the keys. We've got them. 

78
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.470
Hooray!

79
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.900
There you go!

80
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.590
Thank you, Mr. Bull. 

81
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.780
Oh, it was nothing. 

82
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.950
Er…where's the beauty spot gone?

83
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.320
The Mountain Beauty Spot is now a big hole. 

84
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.840
It's a cave now. 
Welcome to the Cave Beauty Spot. 

85
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.040
Woo!

86
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.240
All thanks to my daddy!

87
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.890
Err…and Mr. Bull. 

88
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.130
Yes, I'm good at digging holes. 

89
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.660
Mr. Bull loves digging holes. 
Everybody loves digging holes.
