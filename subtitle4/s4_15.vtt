1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:18.304
Captain Daddy Dog

7
00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:22.034
Peppa and her friends 
are playing at Danny Dog's house. 

8
00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:26.214
I'm a sea captain, 
sailing across the sea. 

9
00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:30.574
We are jolly pirates,
 shivery timbers. 

10
00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:31.554
Ahha!

11
00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:35.964
It's the posts.

12
00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:38.514
It is Mr. Zebra, the postman. 

13
00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:42.504
Hello, Mummy Dog. 
I've got a postcard for you. 

14
00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:43.834
Thank you, Mr. Zebra. 

15
00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:45.054
Bye now. 

16
00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:47.542
Who is the postcard from, Mummy?

17
00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:49.622
It's from Captain Dog. 

18
00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:50.612
Daddy!

19
00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:55.712
He's finished his sailing trip 
around the world and he's coming home.

20
00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:56.602
Woo!

21
00:00:56.702 --> 00:01:00.432
How exciting! 
I wonder when he'll be back. 

22
00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:03.532
Ahoy, there, Mr. Zebra. 

23
00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:06.022
Hello, Captain Dog. 

24
00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:08.402
Hello!

25
00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:14.872
Daddy! Danny!

26
00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:18.342
Captain Dog is home from the sea. 

27
00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:20.612
My Captain Dog!

28
00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:23.912
Mummy Dog! My sweet heart!

29
00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.652
How long are you home for, Daddy?

30
00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:27.862
Forever!

31
00:01:27.862 --> 00:01:30.712
I've decided my travelling days are over.

32
00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:34.242
I've been around the world and made me fortune. 

33
00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:35.282
Woo!

34
00:01:35.382 --> 00:01:37.042
And lost it again.

35
00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:37.452
Oh!

36
00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:39.152
And made it again. 

37
00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.412
Hooray!

38
00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:42.662
Ah! I love to travel. 

39
00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:45.902
But that something I really miss
 when I'm away.

40
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:46.932
What, Daddy?

41
00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:49.922
My darlings, of course!

42
00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:51.552
Ha ha ha. 

43
00:01:52.652 --> 00:01:56.742
So I'm hanging up my Captain's hat for good. 

44
00:01:58.082 --> 00:02:02.192
Let me tell you all about my travels. 

45
00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:09.142
I've been away for a year and a day,
 sailing around the world. 

46
00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:10.592
All the way around?

47
00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:11.722
Yes. 

48
00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:13.922
What did you do at the bottom?

49
00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:15.442
Did you fall off?

50
00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:18.322
No, I held on tightly. 

51
00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:19.302
Wow! 

52
00:02:19.402 --> 00:02:21.292
What an adventure!

53
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:25.582
It was, and I brought back presents
 for all of you. 

54
00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:27.942
Woo! Presents!

55
00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:32.282
Here's a drum for Danny,
 from a faraway jungle. 

56
00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:33.652
Thank you, Daddy. 

57
00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:36.502
Very good, Danny. 

58
00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:38.512
I can bang it louder. 

59
00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:42.482
Perhaps that's enough banging for now. 

60
00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:47.332
And for all your friends, 
some seashells from a desert island. 

61
00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:48.342
Woo!

62
00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:52.492
If you hold them to your ear,
 you can hear the sea. 

63
00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:56.042
Yes, I can hear the seaside. 

64
00:02:56.142 --> 00:03:01.882
And for my darling Mummy Dog,
 a chest of golden jewels.

65
00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:06.282
Wow! How lovely. 
That will come in handy. 

66
00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:08.612
Ah! It's great to be home. 

67
00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:13.792
It is morning. Captain Dog is up early. 

68
00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:18.732
Daddy, what are you doing?

69
00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.872
I'm checking the wind, Danny. 

70
00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:21.642
Why?

71
00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:25.472
Sailors always check the wind
 before they sail. 

72
00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.952
But you are not a sailor any more. 

73
00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:31.532
Oh, yes. I did say that, didn't I?

74
00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.692
Do you miss the sea, Daddy?

75
00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:39.332
No, no. I don't miss the sea.
 But I do miss my boat. 

76
00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:43.182
I've got a boat that Granddad Dog made for me. 

77
00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:46.642
Aa-ha! That's an exact copy of my boat. 

78
00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:48.832
You could help me sail it. 

79
00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:50.732
That sounds like fun. 

80
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:55.122
Peppa and her friends are at the duck pond. 

81
00:03:55.222 --> 00:04:00.142
Ahoy, there, shipmates. 
Room for another boat on the briny waters?

82
00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:00.972
Yes. 

83
00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:06.872
Excellent! Danny, our boat needs a captain.
 It can't sail itself. 

84
00:04:06.972 --> 00:04:10.432
Daddy, will you be my boat's captain?

85
00:04:10.532 --> 00:04:14.232
I'll be delighted, Danny,
 if you'll be my first mate. 

86
00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:15.632
Yes, please. 

87
00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:17.162
Launch the boat. 

88
00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:18.712
A-ya Captain!

89
00:04:18.812 --> 00:04:22.842
Wind is surf westerly. The waters are come. 

90
00:04:22.942 --> 00:04:28.802
My last adventure was sailing a boat
 around the world.

91
00:04:28.902 --> 00:04:37.632
My next adventure is sailing a boat
 across a duck pond! Ah ha ha!

92
00:04:37.732 --> 00:04:40.762
Captain Dog likes sailing across duck ponds.

93
00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:44.062
Everyone likes sailing across duck ponds.
