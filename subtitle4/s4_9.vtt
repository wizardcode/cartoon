1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:18.574
The Rainy Day Game   

7
00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:22.244
It is raining. 
Peppa and George have to stay inside.

8
00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:24.754
I don't like rainy days.

9
00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:29.414
I like rainy days 
because they make muddy puddles to jump in.

10
00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:32.394
Can we jump in muddy puddles now?

11
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:38.164
Peppa, we need to wait until it stops raining.

12
00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.084
When will it stop?

13
00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:43.154
Let's listen to the weather forecast.

14
00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:47.284
This is the weather forecast.
 It will rain all day.

15
00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:48.214
Oh!

16
00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:52.194
I know. We can play the rainy day game.

17
00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:54.664
What's the rainy day game?

18
00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:56.124
I'll show you.

19
00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:01.684
If I take this rubber duck, 
and hide it where you can see it.

20
00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:03.314
Do you think you could find it?

21
00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:08.284
Daddy, if we can see it, 
you haven't hidden it.

22
00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:15.790
Watch this. I will put the duck here.
 Now, you tell me where it is.

23
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.590
There.

24
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.870
Exactly.

25
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.130
It's too easy, Daddy.

26
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.610
It won't always be so easy, Peppa.

27
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.270
Who wants to go first?

28
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.230
Because it's an easy game,
 George can go first.

29
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.670
OK, you all wait here.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
Daddy Pig is putting the rubber duck
 somewhere for George to find.

31
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.160
The duck is somewhere in your bedroom.

32
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.510
George is looking for the rubber duck.
 But it is quite difficult to find.

33
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.160
George, you can see it.
 Just look with your eyes.

34
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.510
George is using his eyes
 to look for the rubber duck.

35
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.200
You're getting warmer, colder. Warmer again.

36
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.100
George has found the rubber duck.

37
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.410
Hooray! 

38
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.970
I saw it straight away.
 This game is too easy.

39
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.560
OK, Peppa's turn. 
I will do the hiding this time.

40
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.640
Mummy Pig is going to put the rubber duck
 somewhere for Peppa to find.

41
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.920
I will see it straight away.

42
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.320
Ready! The rubber duck
 is somewhere in the kitchen.

43
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.840
I've come to find you, rubber ducky.

44
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.530
I know where you are, 
you're in the sink. Oh.

45
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.210
The rubber duck is not in the sink. 
I know, you are hiding under the table.

46
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.530
The rubber duck is not under the table.

47
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.700
Give me a clue, please.

48
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.370
It's sitting 
with something else that's yellow.

49
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.860
Something yellow that lives in the kitchen.

50
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.190
Bananas. There you are.

51
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.820
Peppa has found the rubber duck.
 It was in the fruit bowl.

52
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.780
Hooray! Well-done.

53
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.800
I want to play the rainy day game again.

54
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.530
OK, this time 
you can both look for the duck.

55
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.940
Daddy Pig is putting the rubber duck 
somewhere for Peppa and George to find.

56
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.000
Ready, I'm in the sitting room.

57
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.240
Is it on the sofa?

58
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.470
No.

59
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.460
Is it on the television?

60
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.570
No.

61
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.470
It's not anywhere.

62
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.040
Would you like a clue? 

63
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.930
It's sitting on something very big,
 and very wise.

64
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.110
And very handsome.

65
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.860
Daddy, it's on your head. 
That's the best hiding place ever.

66
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.850
Oh, the rain has stopped.

67
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.510
Why don't we play outside?

68
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.990
But I want to play the rainy day game again.

69
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.520
I think you might like 
this outside rainy day game even better.

70
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.190
What is this game? Give me a clue.

71
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.200
We need to find a muddy puddle.

72
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.610
I found it. Is that the game?

73
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.890
This game is not just about the finding, Peppa.
 What do you do with a muddy puddle?

74
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:29.260
Hmm, jump up and down.
 Jumping up and down in muddy puddles!

75
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860
I like rainy day games,

76
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:42.196
especially the one when you jump 
up and down in muddy puddles.
