00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.939
Kylie Kangaroo

7
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.129
It is a lovely sunny day.

8
00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:23.579
Mr. and Mrs. Kangaroo have come to visit. 

9
00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:25.819
Hello. 

10
00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.250
Gooduh, Mr. Pig. We met at the airport. Remember?

11
00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:30.114
Erm…

12
00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:33.954
It was a while back. 
You said we could visit anytime. 

13
00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:34.854
Did I?

14
00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:39.274
Yes, since we last saw you.
 We've had Kylie and Joey. 

15
00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:41.155
Say hello, kids. 

16
00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.054
Hello, I'm Kylie Kangaroo. 

17
00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:49.975
I'm Peppa Pig. 
And this is my little brother George. 

18
00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:52.674
This is my little brother Joey. 

19
00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:56.545
Joey lives in Mummy Kangaroo's pocket. 

20
00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:01.265
It's thirsty work, this traveling around.
 Would you like a drink?

21
00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:02.505
Yes, please. 

22
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:06.395
Lemonade! My favourite. 

23
00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:08.435
Mmm. That's lovely. 

24
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.065
Yeah, sit down. Are you hungry?

25
00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:12.785
I'm always hungry. 

26
00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.095
No worries. We'll make lunch. 

27
00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:20.015
Mr. Kangaroo is going to cook lunch
 on a barbecue. 

28
00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:21.785
Corn on the cob. Anyone?

29
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:22.785
Yummy!

30
00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:25.225
We should do this at our house.

31
00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:28.655
Hang on! This is our house. 

32
00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.835
Come on, Kylie. Let's play in the garden.

33
00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:39.565
We can play my favourite game―
jumping up and down in muddy puddles. 

34
00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.425
I like jumping too. 

35
00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.635
First, we have to find a puddle. 

36
00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:48.415
Oh, there aren't any muddy puddles.

37
00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.285
The ground is too dry for muddy puddles. 

38
00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:53.345
I wish it would rain. 

39
00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.395
I hope it doesn't rain. 

40
00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:58.955
Oh, we'd love rain. 
We don't see much back home. 

41
00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:03.555
Well, if you want make it rain
 in this country, have a barbecue. 

42
00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.765
We can still do jumping.

43
00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:16.805
George is quite good at jumping,
 but I am the best. Watch this. 

44
00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:22.145
That's how you do it. Now, you try, Kylie. 

45
00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:24.375
OK. 

46
00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.305
Kangaroos can jump very high. 

47
00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:28.305
Wow!

48
00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:30.125
Here is Rebecca Rabbit. 

49
00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:34.375
Hello, Rebecca. This is my friend, Kylie. 

50
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:36.525
Hello, Kylie. Gree!

51
00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.025
Are you playing a game?

52
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.145
We are jumping. 

53
00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:43.775
Rabbits are the best at jumping. Watch this.

54
00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:50.705
Well-done, Rebecca! 
But that's not as good as my friend Kylie. 

55
00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.535
Go on, do your jump!

56
00:02:53.635 --> 00:02:55.375
I don't want to show off. 

57
00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:56.525
Do it!

58
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:57.385
OK.

59
00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:01.065
That is high. 

60
00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:04.475
Kylie Kangaroo is the best at jumping.

61
00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:06.155
Here is Pedro Pony. 

62
00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:07.465
Hello, everyone!

63
00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:09.505
Hello, Pedro.

64
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:13.425
This is my friend, Kylie Kangaroo.

65
00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.195
She's my friend. 

66
00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.915
She can jump higher than anyone. 

67
00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:23.575
No one can jump higher than me
 on my super space opal! 

68
00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.225
Show him, Kylie. 

69
00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:29.605
But Pedro did really well. 

70
00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:30.915
Do it!

71
00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:31.955
OK.

72
00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.565
Wow!

73
00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:38.025
Kylie Kangaroo is the best at jumping.

74
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:42.125
I can jump higher, 
but I'm a little bit tired. 

75
00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:44.845
Er…what was that?

76
00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:46.525
It is raining. 

77
00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:51.325
Like I said, if you want it to rain,
 start a barbecue. 

78
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.905
I'm afraid we'll all have to go indoors. 

79
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:56.525
What? And miss the rain?

80
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:03.905
Mr. Kangaroo has got a big umbrella 
to shelter everyone from the rain. 

81
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:06.215
Food's ready! Who's hungry?

82
00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:07.395
Me! Me!

83
00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.215
Mmm, yummy!

84
00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:12.335
Peppa likes cone on the cob. 

85
00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:13.665
Mmm. Mmm.

86
00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:15.875
Everyone likes cone on the cob. 

87
00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:17.895
It's stopped raining. 

88
00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:21.615
The rain makes everything so fresh and green. 

89
00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:22.945
And wet. 

90
00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.325
And muddy. 

91
00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:30.005
This is how you jump in muddy puddles. 

92
00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:33.165
Wow! That looks fun. 

93
00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:36.424
I'm the best at jumping, but Peppa

94
00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:41.374
 is the best at jumping up and down
 in muddy puddles.
