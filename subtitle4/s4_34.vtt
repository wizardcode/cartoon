1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.869
The Sandpit

7
00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.620
Peppa and her friends are playing in the sandpit. 

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.789
This sandpit is a desert island.
 We'll live here forever. 

9
00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.289
If we are going to live here forever,
 I want it to be nice. 

10
00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.759
It just needs some houses. 

11
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.210
And roads. 

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.159
And shops. 

13
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:39.859
Dinosaur!

14
00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:41.240
Grrrr.

15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.759
Yes, George. 

16
00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.579
The desert island can have dinosaurs too. 

17
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.960
What are you doing?

18
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.279
We are making a desert island. 

19
00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.939
It's got houses and roads and shops. 

20
00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.560
Has it got trees?

21
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.120
No!

22
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.630
It would be nicer if it had trees. 

23
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.390
Where are we going to get trees from?

24
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.710
We have to drive big trucks 
around the world and look for trees. 

25
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.650
Dinosaurs, you look after the island,
 while we go and look for some trees. 

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.950
Broom! Broom! Broom! Vroom! Vroom!

27
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.219
Peppa, Susie, Danny and Emily are pretending
 to drive around the world, looking for trees. 

28
00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.959
Broom! Broom! Broom! Vroom! Vroom!

29
00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:27.359
Hello, Mummy Rabbit. 
Have you got any spare trees?

30
00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:28.280
Er…

31
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.279
We need trees for our desert island. 

32
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:34.639
Oh, I see! 
How many trees would you like?

33
00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.510
Enough to make a forest!

34
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.439
There you go! 

35
00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.069
Thank you!

36
00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:41.260
Broom! Broom! Broom! Vroom! Vroom!

37
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.280
Grrrr.

38
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.609
The dinosaurs are having fun jumping
 up and down on the desert island. 

39
00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:49.799
The dinosaurs have broken everything!

40
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.280
Naughty dinosaurs!

41
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.870
Now we'll have to make all again. 

42
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.709
What are you making?

43
00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:00.339
This is our desert island. 

44
00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.630
With roads and houses. 

45
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.189
And shops and trees. 

46
00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.870
There! We'll live here forever. Again!

47
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.999
It will be really good if it has a lake. 

48
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.469
Yes, a lake. 

49
00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.480
One lake. 

50
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.389
But it needs water to be a proper lake. 

51
00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.240
Oh! 

52
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.280
Where are we going to get water from?

53
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.009
We must fly around the world in aeroplanes. 

54
00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.710
Peppa and her friends are pretending 
to fly around the world, looking for water. 

55
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.280
Pedro Pony is playing on the round-a-about. 

56
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.749
Hello, everyone. 

57
00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.439
Hello, Pedro. 
We've got a desert island, with houses. 

58
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.250
And roads. Shops. Trees. And a lake. 

59
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.710
But we need water for the lake.
 Have you got some, please?

60
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.330
I don't know what you are talking about. 

61
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.710
It just pretend. 
We're playing a game. 

62
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.919
Oh, I see. You want pretend water. 

63
00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.979
Yes. 

64
00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.729
Mmm…I know where there's putten and snow.
 We can melt it to get putten water. 

65
00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:13.750
Where?

66
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.229
On the mountain top. 

67
00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.340
But it's a slide. 

68
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.479
It's a putten mountain. 

69
00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.150
Oh!

70
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.120
What's the matter, Pedro?

71
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.659
Because it's a hot day,
 the snow has melted. 

72
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.629
Can't we pretend it hasn't melted? 

73
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.710
No, it's melted good unpopular.

74
00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:35.175
Oh!

75
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:39.175
But look, over there! Real water. 

76
00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:42.195
Daddy Pig is drinking from the water fountain. 

77
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:43.254
Water!

78
00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:50.364
Daddy, can we have some water
 in our bucket, please?

79
00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:51.955
We're making a lake. 

80
00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.395
Oh-oh! Of course. 

81
00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:59.485
We've got water. 

82
00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:01.944
Nice water!

83
00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:05.275
It is Freddy Fox. 

84
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.935
Hello, everyone. What's this?

85
00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:12.264
It's a desert island. 
We are going to live here forever. 

86
00:04:12.364 --> 00:04:14.895
If only it had a flag. 

87
00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:18.424
I've got a flag in my van if you'd like it. 

88
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.944
Mr. Fox has got everything in his van. 

89
00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:26.605
Er. we only need a pretend one, Mr. Fox. 

90
00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:29.105
OK. How about this?

91
00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:31.295
Thank you, Mr. Fox. 

92
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.925
Now, our desert island is perfect. 

93
00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:41.855
We will live here forever. Again!
