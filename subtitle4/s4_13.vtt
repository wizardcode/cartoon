00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.059
The Flying Vet

7
00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.370
Peppa has brought Goody the fish
 to the vet for a check-up. 

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.960
You've got a healthy happy fish. 

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.489
Thank you, Doctor Hamster! 

10
00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.390
Hello.

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.479
Hello, Doctor Hamster! This is Mr. Elephant. 

12
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.110
Mr. Elephant and his family are out for a walk
 in the mountains. 

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.390
We've found a sick lizard. 

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.679
It's a gecko. 

15
00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:46.390
Edmond knows all about lizards.
 He is a clever-clogs. 

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.649
I'll be straight there. 

17
00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.729
Woo! Can we come too?

18
00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.369
Of course! Let's go!

19
00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:58.109
Are we going in an ambulance?

20
00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:01.619
No. The mountain's too far away!

21
00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.200
 We'll go in my aeroplane!

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.209
Woo! 

23
00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.099
Aeroplane! Mow!

24
00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:10.439
George loves aeroplanes. 

25
00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.209
All aboard!

26
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.629
Up bounds away!

27
00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.220
I didn't know you had an aeroplane,
 Doctor Hamster!

28
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.200
Oh, yes! I'm the flying vet. 

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.859
Thank goodness. The vet's here. 

30
00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:34.590
Stand aside. Vet's coming through!

31
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.760
Where's the sick lizard?

32
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.909
Here it is!

33
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.659
Oh, poor little gecko. 

34
00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.140
What is wrong with the lizard?

35
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.340
It seems to be upside down. 
Are you slipped over? There!

36
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.580
Doctor Hamster has made the lizard better. 

37
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.900
Hooray!

38
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.409
Oh, another emergency. 

39
00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.989
Hello. 

40
00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:01.349
Hello, Grandpa Pig here. 

41
00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:03.979
Grandpa Pig is out sailing his boat. 

42
00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.570
It's Polly. She's a sick parrot. 

43
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.467
Er. Sick parrot.

44
00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.667
I'll be right there. 

45
00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:17.227
Look, Polly. It's the flying vet. 

46
00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:19.897
Where are we going to land?

47
00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:22.267
This is a seaplane, Peppa.  

48
00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:24.777
We can land on the water.

49
00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:27.137
Wow!

50
00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:32.037
Hello, Peppa? George?

51
00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:37.027
Hello, Grandpa.
 We've come to make Polly better. 

52
00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:39.647
How long has Polly been sick?

53
00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:42.457
Since we came out on our boat trip. 

54
00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:48.247
Uh-ha! I know what's wrong with Polly.
 She's sea sick. 

55
00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:49.297
Oh?

56
00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:51.456
Get Polly to dry land. 

57
00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:53.006
The sooner the better. 

58
00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:55.547
There's an island.

59
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.267
There we go! 

60
00:02:58.267 --> 00:02:59.807
Better Polly?

61
00:02:59.907 --> 00:03:01.597
Er. better Polly. 

62
00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:02.757
Hooray! 

63
00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:05.737
Polly is not a sick parrot anymore. 

64
00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:08.947
Oh, another emergency. 

65
00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:09.857
Hello. 

66
00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.027
Hello, Daddy Pig here. 

67
00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:14.157
Daddy Pig is in his office. 

68
00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:17.137
There are some ducklings stuck on our roof. 

69
00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:18.887
I'll be right there.

70
00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:26.857
Thank goodness, you're here. 

71
00:03:28.857 --> 00:03:32.537
Stand aside. Doctor Hamster's here. 

72
00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:36.107
Mrs. Duck laid her eggs on our roof. 

73
00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:39.127
And now the ducklings have hatched. 

74
00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:43.457
Who can make a quacking noise?

75
00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.917
Me! I'm very good at quacking. 

76
00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:52.007
Peppa, start quacking 
and the ducklings will follow you. 

77
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.637
Quack! Quack! Quack! 

78
00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:55.346
Quack! Quack! Quack! 

79
00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:01.184
Lead them to the duck pond please, Peppa. 

80
00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.034
OK, I'm Mummy Duck. 

81
00:04:04.134 --> 00:04:07.745
Quack! Quack! Quack! 

82
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:18.074
The ducklings are back with their mummy and daddy. 

83
00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.355
All because of me. 

84
00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:21.814
Ho ho ho!

85
00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:23.824
Hello. 

86
00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:27.605
Is it another emergency?

87
00:04:27.705 --> 00:04:30.842
Yes, it's Mr. Hamster. 

88
00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:33.770
I'm late for my tea. Bye!

89
00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:35.954
Bye-bye, Doctor Hamster. 

90
00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:37.064
Thank you. 

91
00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:38.895
No problem. 

92
00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:42.995
It's all in a day's work, got a flying vet.
