1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.022
Mummy Rabbit's Bump   

7
00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:22.432
Peppa and George are playing 
with Susie Sheep and Pedro Pony.

8
00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:25.482
 Here are Rebecca and Richard Rabbit. 

9
00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:27.712
Hello, Rebecca. 

10
00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:30.062
Gree, I've got a secret. 

11
00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.272
What is it?

12
00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.882
My Mummy's got a bump in her tummy. 

13
00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:34.892
Woo!

14
00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.502
Has she eaten too much?

15
00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:40.782
No, there's a baby rabbit inside. 

16
00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:45.982
Mummy Rabbit, is there really
 a baby rabbit in your tummy?

17
00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.852
Yes. Would you like to listen to it?

18
00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:50.222
Yes, please. 

19
00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:53.752
Can you hear a little heart beat?

20
00:00:53.852 --> 00:00:58.742
Yes, I can. 
It's going "Boom! Boom! Boom!". 

21
00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:01.442
Oh, it just moved. 

22
00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:05.102
Yes, sometimes babies give a little kick. 

23
00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:07.402
What will you call it?

24
00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:11.182
I don't know. 
Would you children like to think of the name?

25
00:01:11.382 --> 00:01:12.452
Yes, please!

26
00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:15.802
Hello, Mummy Rabbit. 
Would you like a cup of coffee?

27
00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:19.292
I can't have coffee, 
but I am quite hungry. 

28
00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:20.672
Would you like carrots?

29
00:01:20.772 --> 00:01:23.722
I'm a bit off carrots. 
Have you got any potatoes?

30
00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:25.142
Yes, we do. 

31
00:01:25.242 --> 00:01:30.872
Maybe a potato with jelly, and cheese,
 and strawberry jam, please. 

32
00:01:30.972 --> 00:01:31.992
Errrr.

33
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.612
A potato with jelly, cheese,
 and strawberry jam? 

34
00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:37.732
What a funny mixture of food!

35
00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:41.202
We need to think of a name for the baby. 

36
00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:46.542
Yes. If the baby is a girl, 
she'll be called Rachel Rabbit. 

37
00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:49.592
Or how about Rust Rabbit?

38
00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:51.332
Wroxham Rabbit. 

39
00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:52.732
Shawn Rabbit. 

40
00:01:52.832 --> 00:01:55.282
I don't think so, Pedro. 

41
00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.952
Shawn Rabbit sounds wrong. 

42
00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:00.132
I like Rosie. 

43
00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:03.842
Rosie Rabbit? It's perfect. 

44
00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:06.842
But what if the baby is a boy?

45
00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:07.622
Oh?

46
00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:11.452
How about Roofers Rabbit?

47
00:02:11.552 --> 00:02:13.482
Raymond Rabbit. 

48
00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:14.972
Michael Rabbit. 

49
00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.872
Michael Rabbit? No!

50
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.182
Robbie Rabbit!

51
00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:22.442
Yes, Robbie Rabbit. 

52
00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:27.328
Thank you for the potatoes with jelly,
 cheese, and strawberry jam, Mummy Pig. 

53
00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:28.592
My pleasure. 

54
00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:31.312
We thought of a name for the baby. 

55
00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:35.302
Rosie if it's a girl 
and Robbie if it's a boy. 

56
00:02:35.402 --> 00:02:37.182
They're lovely names. 

57
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.922
It's sad that the baby can't have both names.

58
00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:42.972
Oh, my tummy!

59
00:02:43.072 --> 00:02:45.862
It's all that funny food you've been eaten.

60
00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:49.152
I don't think so, Daddy Rabbit.
 The baby is coming. 

61
00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:54.692
Right! To the hospital!
 Quickly, now! Ward pharmic!  

62
00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:55.732
Bye!

63
00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:57.842
Bye! Good luck. 

64
00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:00.782
Did you pack everything on the list?

65
00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:02.367
I've got it all. 

66
00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:09.000
Pillows, some dicty candles, yoga music, 
and enough food for three days. 

67
00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:14.602
Ward pharmic! Ward pharmic! 
Anyone in? We are having a rabbit!

68
00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:17.602
Hello, sister. What are you doing here?

69
00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:19.902
I'm having a baby, remember?

70
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.892
Oh, yes! You'd better come inside then. 

71
00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:24.342
Can I come too?

72
00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:27.902
Moo! You'll have to park the car first. 

73
00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:33.152
But don't worry.
 Having a baby always takes a long time. 

74
00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:40.022
Out of the way, everyone.
 My sister's having a baby. 

75
00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:43.960
A canteen, and a dozen of towel. 

76
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.310
 This lot should last us a good few days. 

77
00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:51.262
Oh, where should I put all this stuff?

78
00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:54.072
Back in the car! We don't need it now. 

79
00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:54.892
What? 

80
00:03:54.992 --> 00:03:58.622
Gree! Daddy, you missed all the excitement. 

81
00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:01.592
Have I? Is it a boy or a girl?

82
00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:05.252
Both! We've got baby twins. 

83
00:04:05.352 --> 00:04:06.622
Wow! 

84
00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:11.742
It is the next day. 
And Mummy Rabbit is home from hospital. 

85
00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:15.472
Hello, can we see the twins, please?

86
00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:17.542
Of course, Peppa. 

87
00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:23.222
Are they boys or girls?

88
00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:26.642
They are both. A boy and a girl. 

89
00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:29.312
They are called Rosie and Robbie. 

90
00:04:29.412 --> 00:04:31.732
So you did use both names. 

91
00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:32.952
Yes!

92
00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:36.662
Rosie Rabbit, and Robbie Rabbit.

93
00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:42.032
They are the best names in the world.
 And we thought of them.
