00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:44.387
Leave George alone,he's only little.

52
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.236
What's so on this noise about, then? 

53
00:02:50.327 --> 00:02:55.327
They're trying to push us out of the sand pit.

54
00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:57.122
No, we're not.

55
00:02:57.222 --> 00:02:58.322

00:02:58.442 --> 00:03:00.462
George started...

57
00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:05.642
Oh, dear, the countries of the world
 are not playing nicely together.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:11.522
Peace and harmony in all the w...
what's that noise?

59
00:03:11.622 --> 00:03:14.942
Oh, no! The countries are fighting.

60
00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:18.052
You can't play in the sand pit. 

61
00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:19.342
Yes, we can.

62
00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:20.962
That's not fair.

63
00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:25.432
Stop arguing.

64
00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:30.532
Susie, 
you're always telling people what to do!

65
00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:31.952
No, I am not.

00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:36.861
Children, children, what is happening?

67
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:42.752
America, Russia, Spain and Greece
 won't share the sand pit.

68
00:03:42.852 --> 00:03:45.272
Holland is being bossy.

69
00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:46.962
You are the bossy one.

70
00:03:47.062 --> 00:03:48.722
That is enough.

71
00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:52.872
Is this how you think 
the countries of the world behave?

72
00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:55.462
Don't they?

73
00:03:55.562 --> 00:03:57.052
Of course not.

74
00:03:57.152 --> 00:03:59.012
Sorry, Madame Gazelle.

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:01.442
