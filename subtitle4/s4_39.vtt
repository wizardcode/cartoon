00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.839
The End of the Holiday

7
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.070
It is the last morning 
of Peppa's holiday in Italy. 

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.089
I'm just going for one last walk. 

9
00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.779
Going for one last swim, Mr. Pig?

10
00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.840
Er, yes. 
One last swim before I go home. 

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.560
I want to stay on holiday forever. 

12
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.120
Holidays are nice, 
but they don't last forever, Peppa. 

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.000
Think of all your friends 
waiting for you back home. 

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.220
Yes, I miss my friends. 
And I miss Goldie the fish. Can I telephone Goldie?

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.420
OK, Peppa. 

16
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.079
Granny and Grandpa Pig are looking
 after Goldie the fish
 while Peppa is on holiday. 

17
00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.369
Hello?

18
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.170
Hello, Granny. How's Goldie?

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.060
Erm, she's eating well. 

20
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.170
I sent Goldie a postcard. Does she like it?

21
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.129
The postcard hasn't arrived yet, 
Peppa. But I'm sure it will be here soon. 

22
00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.580
Oh! We are coming home today. See you later. 

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.609
See you later. 

24
00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:25.069
Suzy Sheep has come to play with Peppa. 

25
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:26.339
Hello, Suzy. 

26
00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.450
Hello, Granny Pig.
 Is Peppa back from holiday?

27
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.670
Not yet, Suzy.
 But she's coming back today. 

28
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.790
Oh! Suzy is missing Peppa. 

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.969
This suitcase's heavy.
 Are you sure we need all this stuff, Mummy Pig?

30
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.129
These are import souvenirs
 from our holiday. 

31
00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.989
OK!

32
00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:50.430
Is everybody ready?

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.040
Yes, Daddy Pig. 

34
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.009
Yes! Did you have a nice time?

35
00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.300
It rained every day. 

36
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.399
Oh, goody. That means 
there'll be muddy puddles. 

37
00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:33.869
Peppa and Suzy love 
jumping up and down in muddy puddles. 

38
00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.959
Holidays are nice. 
But coming home to muddy puddles is even better.
