1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.609
Peppa and George's Garden

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.429
Daddy Pig is sitting in his favorite sunny spot. 

8
00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.699
Ah! What a perfect day for doing nothing!

9
00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:29.449
Daddy Pig loves doing nothing. 

10
00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:33.560
How could this be better? I know! A cup of tea!

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.630
Grandpa Pig has come to see Peppa and George. 

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.960
Grandpa Pig. 

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.280
Papa ig! 

14
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.439
Hello, Peppa and George! 

15
00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.979
You are going to have your very own flower garden. 

16
00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.909
Woo! A garden for George and me!

17
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.439
I've got a packet of flower seeds for each of you.

18
00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.020
Now, we need a nice sunny spot to plant your seeds.  

19
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.679
Here we are!

20
00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:05.900
Grandpa Pig is digging Peppa and George's garden. 

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.980
Oh!

22
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.620
Ah! Tea for the workers. Thank you, Daddy Pig. 

23
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.510
Er…what's going on?

24
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.920
We are making a flower garden. 

25
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.809
Do we need a flower garden?

26
00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:19.620
Yes! 

27
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.849
But that's where I sit in my chair. 

28
00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:25.769
There are more important things
 than chairs, Daddy Pig.

29
00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.900
But I always read my newspapers here. 

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.200
There are more important things
 than newspapers, Daddy Pig.

31
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.329
Yes, like flowers. 

32
00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.569
Look, Daddy. 

33
00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.700
Peppa has lots of flower seeds.

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.629
 George only has one flower seed,
 but it is quite a big seed. 

35
00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.129
Could you fetch us some water, Daddy Pig?

36
00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.959
Mm…OK!

37
00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:57.549
Seeds need water to grow.
 They get very thirsty. 

38
00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.700
Some little birds have come to watch. 

39
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.719
Don't let the birds eat the seeds, Peppa. 

40
00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.060
Shoo! Shoo! Fly away, birdies. 

41
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.610
Here is the water. 

42
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.219
Daddy scared the birds away. 

43
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.620
Ho-oh! Daddy Pig looks like a scare crow. 

44
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.952
Ha ha ha!

45
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:22.732
Peppa, George, bath time!

46
00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.182
Oh, but what if the birdies come back?

47
00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:27.552
Don't worry, Peppa. 

48
00:02:27.652 --> 00:02:30.422
I'll make sure the birds don't eat the seeds. 

49
00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:32.122
Thank you, Daddy. 

50
00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:35.662
Good luck, Daddy Pig. See you tomorrow. 

51
00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:36.712
Bye!

52
00:02:37.772 --> 00:02:41.742
Ah, this is nice. 

53
00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:46.292
Daddy, you have to be the scare crow. 

54
00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:50.642
What? Oh! Shoo! Shoo! Naughty birds. 

55
00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:55.812
Now, stay there until the birdies go to bed. 

56
00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:57.972
OK, Peppa. 

57
00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:01.952
All the birdies have gone to bed.

58
00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:04.442
Daddy Pig can go inside now.

59
00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:08.902
It is morning.

60
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:12.682
George, let's look at our flower garden. 

61
00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:16.622
Woo! Baby plants. 

62
00:03:16.722 --> 00:03:21.562
Morning! Ah, your plants have started to grow.

63
00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:23.882
 Soon, they'll have flowers on them.  

64
00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:26.732
A little snail has come to take a look. 

65
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:30.702
Oh, dear! Snails like eating plants. 

66
00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:34.792
Grandpa Pig, can you take Barbra to your garden. 

67
00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:40.065
Erm…OK, I'll take care of Barbra. 

68
00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:43.425
It is one week later. 

69
00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.705
Peppa, George, come and look. 

70
00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:51.235
My flowers! They are so pretty. 

71
00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:53.645
And look at George's plant. 

72
00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.425
It's a beanstalk.

73
00:03:56.525 --> 00:04:01.395
And it goes all the way up to a giant's castle. 

74
00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:06.385
Oh-oh. No, Peppa. But it does go quite high. 

75
00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:10.715
George's flower is taller than our house. 

76
00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:14.685
Oh-ho! George's grown a sunflower.

77
00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:16.335
 Well-done, George. 

78
00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:19.285
I love our flower garden. 

79
00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:23.125
Now, let's make you a vegetable garden. 

80
00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:26.875
But that's where I sit in my chair. 

81
00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:31.777
There are more important things
 than chairs, Daddy Pig.

82
00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:35.857
Like tomatoes, carrots, and potatoes. 

83
00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:38.209
I do like a nice potato. 

84
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:40.374
Daddy pig loves potatoes.

85
00:04:40.474 --> 00:04:43.914
 Everyone loves potatoes.
