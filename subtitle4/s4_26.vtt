1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.039
Madame Gazelle's Leaving Party

7
00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.654
It is home time at Peppa's playgroup. 

8
00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:25.794
Children, next week, 
there won't be any playgroup. 

9
00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:27.964
Why, Madame Gazelle?

10
00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:29.604
I am going away. 

11
00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:30.444
Oh!

12
00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:32.664
Goodbye, children.

13
00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:35.274
Goodbye, Madame Gazelle. 

14
00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:38.264
Peppa and George are home from playgroup. 

15
00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:41.454
Mummy, there is no more playgroup. 

16
00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.024
No more playgroup?

17
00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:46.324
Madame Gazelle is going away. 

18
00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:49.374
I suppose she has been teaching a long time. 

19
00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:53.864
Madame Gazelle taught all the mummies and daddies
 when they were children. 

20
00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:56.647
Madame Gazelle taught me everything I know. 

21
00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:58.977
Who can count to three?

22
00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:02.527
One! Two! Three! Hee! Hee! Hee!

23
00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:06.767
Thinking about it, 
Madame Gazelle must be very old. 

24
00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.067
Which is probably why she decided to stop teaching. 

25
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:14.727
I know! 
We should give Madame Gazelle a leaving party. 

26
00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:17.077
That sounds fun. 

27
00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:20.487
It is the day of Madame Gazelle's leaving party.

28
00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.587
Everyone has come to help. 

29
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:29.331
Pedro, you stay outside and tell us
 if Madame Gazelle's coming along. 

30
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.361
Why?

31
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:34.531
We don't want Madame Gazelle catching us
 getting her party ready. 

32
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:37.901
Or it wouldn't be a surprise! OK!

33
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.391
I hope we invited everyone. 

34
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:44.101
What about Madame Gazelle's old friends?

35
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.311
Wasn't she once in a pop group?

36
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.341
That's right! She played guitar!

37
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.481
With that Rocking Gazelles. 

38
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.861
Hello, Rocking Gazelles. 

39
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:00.801
Hello, Madame Gazelle is leaving the playgroup. 

40
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.591
Gigi leaving? How sad!

41
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.651
We are having a party. 

42
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.441
A party? What fun! We'll be there!

43
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:15.391
Good. Everyone's coming. 
Now, let's make the party food. 

44
00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:19.471
This is the playgroup kitchen. 
Everyone is helping with the party food. 

45
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.481
Emily Elephant and Wendy Woof 
are decorating cupcakes. 

46
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.221
I'll do the icing.

47
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.301
I'll sprinkle the hundreds and thousands.

48
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.431
Peppa and George are making jelly. 

49
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:33.081
Wobbly jelly!

50
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.881
Wobble, wobble, wobble. 

51
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:40.101
Pedro Pony is outside, keeping guard. 

52
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.031
Here comes Madame Gazelle. 

53
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.011
Madame Gazelle is coming. 

54
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.471
We are not ready. Stop her, Pedro. 

55
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:47.411
OK!

56
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.091
Hello, Pedro. You are early for playgroup. 

57
00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:53.491
Yes! Don't go inside!

58
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:54.511
Why not?

59
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.381
It's a nice day outie, isn't it?

60
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.811
Erâ€¦yes, Pedro. Can I go inside now?

61
00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:04.501
Oh, no! It's against the law. 

62
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.781
What are you talking about, Pedro?

63
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.961
We're ready. 

64
00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.651
You can go in now. 

65
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:13.021
Surprise!

66
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:16.291
For she's a jolly good fellow, 

67
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.491
For she's a jolly good fellow,

68
00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:20.601
For she's a jolly good fellow, 

69
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.921
And so say all of us. 

70
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.261
Hooray!

71
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:31.331
Here is a present for you!
 An antique clock. 

72
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:32.411
Woo!

73
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:35.111
It's made of solid plastic. 

74
00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:38.871
Thank you. But why is there a party for me?

75
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:44.671
Everyone wanted to thank you 
for being the best teacher in the world. 

76
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.591
So we've made you a leaving party. 

77
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:51.321
Because you are going away forever!

78
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.951
I'm not going away forever. 

79
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:58.521
But you said there was no more playgroup. 

80
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:03.681
Oh, Peppa. All I said was no playgroup next week!

81
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:05.781
I'm going on holiday.

82
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:07.321
Oh!

83
00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:14.451
I will be teaching for many years to come.
 Who else could be the teacher?

84
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:15.841
No one! 

85
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:20.681
I'm very happy. 
Madame Gazelle is not leaving. 

86
00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:24.961
Yes, and I can't think of 
a better reason for a party. 

87
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.721
And every party needs music. 

88
00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:32.481
Oh, ha ha. The rocking Gazelles!

89
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:36.621
Hello, Gigi. Have you still got your guitar?

90
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:40.581
Of course! Let's Rockty Rock!
