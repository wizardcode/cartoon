00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.770
Shadows

7
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.160
It is a lovely sunny day.

8
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.570
Peppa, George and Rebecca Rabbit
 are playing piggy in the middle. 

9
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.510
Catch Peppa. 

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.450
Catch Rebecca. 

11
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.490
George is the piggy in the middle. 

12
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.060
Oh, George is trying to catch the ball shadow. 

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.090
Silly George. That's not the ball.
 that's just its shadow. Look!

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.070
When the ball moves, 
its shadow moves as well. 

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.990
You've got a shadow too, George. 

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.970
George is trying to walk away from his shadow. 

17
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.510
You can't walk away from your shadow. 

18
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.990
You need to run away from it. 

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.940
Peppa is trying to run away from her shadow. 

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.820
Oh, it's still there. 

21
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.820
Hello, everyone!

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.310
Hello, Susie. 
We're trying to run away from our shadows. 

23
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.490
No one can run away from their shadows. 

24
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.370
Oh!

25
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.540
You need to use a scooter. Weeeee!

26
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.340
Susie is trying to ride away from her shadow. 

27
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.710
See!

28
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.370
But your shadow is still there. 

29
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.330
Oh!

30
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.060
Hello, everyone!

31
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.500
Here is Mr. Elephant, with Emily and Edmond. 

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.380
Hello. 

33
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.330
We're trying to run away from our shadows.

34
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.180
You can never run away from your shadow.

35
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.040
I know. We can't go fast enough. 

36
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.250
No, Susie. 
It's nothing to do with how fast you run. 

37
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.520
You see? My shadow is still underneath me. 

38
00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.150
Run faster!

39
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.569
Even if I run faster, my shadow keeps up with me. 

40
00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.379
Daddy, your shadow is too big.
 It's slowing you down. 

41
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.619
It's not that, Emily. 
Your shadow always stays with you. 

42
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:16.189
Why?

43
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:21.829
When something gets in the way of the sun,
 it makes a shadow, like this. 

44
00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.109
Oh!

45
00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.639
I have the biggest shadow,
 because I'm the biggest. 

46
00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.999
And George and I have the smallest shadows,
 because we are the smallest. 

47
00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.399
Very clever, Edmond. 

48
00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:36.259
I'm a clever-clogs. 

49
00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.109
Oh, whose shadow is that? 

50
00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.299
That's the biggest shadow ever. 

51
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.829
It must be a giant. 

52
00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:54.169
He, he, he. It's not a giant. 
The shadow is being made by a cloud. 

53
00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.799
Wow!

54
00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.229
What sort of cloud is it?

55
00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.359
Erm…it's a big cloud. 

56
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.149
It's called a strato cumulus. 

57
00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.199
Yes. 

58
00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.869
Edmond Elephant is a clever-clogs. 

59
00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.269
Look! Our shadows are getting longer. 

60
00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:13.519
Woo!

61
00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:19.419
That's because the sun is getting lower in the sky. 
It's nearly night time. 

62
00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.699
My shadow has gone. 

63
00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.069
Yes, Emily. 
When the sun sets, the shadows go away. 

64
00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.099
Peppa, George, bed time. 

65
00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.049
OK, Daddy. Bye, everyone. 

66
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.589
Bye-bye. 

67
00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.909
It is bed time. 

68
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.049
I'm a bit sad that my shadow's gone away. 

69
00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:44.549
Don't be sad, Peppa.

70
00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:49.739
Electric light can make shadows,
 and we can make shadow puppets. 

71
00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:54.199
Mummy Pig is using her hands 
to make a shadow puppet. 

72
00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.099
It's a birdy. 

73
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.129
Listen to it sing. 

74
00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.189
Tweet, tweet, I'm a little birdy. 

75
00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.829
My turn. 

76
00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.129
Peppa has made a spider. 

77
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.629
My name is Mr. Skinny Legs. 

78
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:11.969
Oops, scary! 

79
00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.189
George is making a shadow puppet. 

80
00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.619
What's that, George?

81
00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.199
Dinosaur!

82
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.549
Grrr…

83
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.269
George has made a dinosaur. 

84
00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:25.909
That's really scary. 

85
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.039
Very good, George. 

86
00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.459
Time to switch the lights out. 

87
00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:36.569
Good night, Peppa. Good night, George.
 Good night, shadows!

88
00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.949
Good night, shadows!
