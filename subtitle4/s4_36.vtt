1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.829
Flying on Holiday

7
00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:24.410
Peppa and George are going on holiday.
 They are packing their bags. 

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.380
You can't pack everything. 

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.339
But we need to take all our toys, Daddy. 

10
00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.499
Ho! Ho! Just take the important ones. 

11
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.530
OK! 

12
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.250
I'll take Teddy, and George can take.

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.719
Dinosaur! Grr.

14
00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.680
Mummy Pig is packing a big bag
 for the holiday. 

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.550
Wow! That's a lot of stuff, Mummy Pig.

16
00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.089
Are you sure we need it all?

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.689
Yes! It's all very important. 

18
00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.719
OK! 

19
00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:04.120
It is Susie Sheep. 

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.159
Hello, Peppa. Do you want to play?

21
00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.489
I can't play today, Susie. 
I'm going on holiday. 

22
00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:13.909
Oh? Where are you going?

23
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.870
I don't know. 
Somewhere where there's holidays. 

24
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.670
That sounds nice. 

25
00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:27.370
Oh! Granny and Grandpa! 
Why are you here?

26
00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.904
We're here for Goodie the fish. 

27
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.614
We are looking after her 
while you are on holiday. 

28
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.584
Here's Goodie. 

29
00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:36.424
Don't feed her too much, Granny. 

30
00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:37.644
OK, Peppa. 

31
00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.825
It is Mr. Bull in his taxi.

32
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:44.055
He's taking Peppa and her family to the airport. 

33
00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:48.474
Hello, Daddy Pig. 
Let me take that bag for you. 

34
00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:55.664
Wow! Ah! That's heavy. 
Are you sure you need everything in here?

35
00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:58.355
Yes, it's all very important. 

36
00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:01.444
Bye! 

37
00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:02.305
Bye!

38
00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:03.674
Bye-bye!

39
00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:09.854
This is the airport. 

40
00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:14.925
Goodbye! Have a lovely holiday. 

41
00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:20.585
Tickets, please. 

42
00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:21.534
Here they are. 

43
00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:22.634
Any bags?

44
00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:26.594
Yes, I'm afraid this one's a bit heavy. 

45
00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:29.485
Don't worry! 
Just pop it on the scales. 

46
00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:34.085
Anything valuable in it?

47
00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:34.784
No?

48
00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:35.594
Any more?

49
00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:36.694
Yes. 

50
00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:39.495
You can take those little bags
 on the plane with you.

51
00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:42.495
Just join the queue over there. 

52
00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.085
This is the X-Ray machine. 

53
00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.025
What's this, Daddy?

54
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.115
It's a machine 
that looks inside things. 

55
00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.264
Woo!

56
00:02:51.364 --> 00:02:53.894
Put your bags on here, please. 

57
00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.965
Look, it's my bag, with Teddy inside. 

58
00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:04.854
Dinosaur! Grrâ€¦

59
00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:08.275
That's magic!

60
00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:13.925
This is the aeroplane that will take
 Peppa and her family on the holiday. 

61
00:03:14.025 --> 00:03:15.294
Aeroplane!

62
00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:18.875
George loves aeroplanes. 

63
00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:25.854
Welcome aboard! 
We hope you enjoy your flight with us today. 

64
00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:28.895
Can I sit next to the window?

65
00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.534
Ha! Ha! Of course, Peppa. 

66
00:03:31.634 --> 00:03:35.395
Yes, George. 
You can sit next to the window too. 

67
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:42.585
This is Captain Emergency speaking.
 Is everybody ready?

68
00:03:42.685 --> 00:03:44.775
Yes, Captain Emergency. 

69
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:46.895
Then let's go. 

70
00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:52.085
Wee!

71
00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:55.944
Look, Teddy. We are flying. 

72
00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:58.784
What can you see out of the window, Peppa?

73
00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:01.435
It's all cloudy and rainy. 

74
00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:08.134
Woo! Now, it's sunny. 

75
00:04:08.134 --> 00:04:13.895
That's because we are on top of the clouds.
 The plane is flying higher and higher. 

76
00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:17.344
Oh! Are we flying up to the sun?

77
00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:21.404
No! But we are going somewhere sunny. 

78
00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:31.084
Flying high in a plane, 
up above the clouds and rain. 

79
00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:37.785
Flying high, sunny sky. 
Flying higher and higher. 

80
00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:44.524
Peppa and her family are flying through the sky,
 on their way to a sunny holiday.
