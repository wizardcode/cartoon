00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:19.120
Grampy Rabbit's Dinosaur Park

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.410
Today is Freddy Fox's birthday and all 
the children are going on a big adventure.

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.560
Where are we going for your birthday, Freddy?

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.429
I don't know, but I can't wait to get there. 

10
00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:35.469
We're here!

11
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:45.640
Welcome to Grampy Rabbit's Dinosaur Park!

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.700
Woo!

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.450
Dinosaur! Grrâ€¦

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.712
George loves dinosaurs. 

15
00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:54.772
Are there really dinosaurs here?

16
00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:57.572
No, just pretend ones. 

17
00:00:57.672 --> 00:00:58.962
Phew!

18
00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:03.762
Real dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. 

19
00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:05.972
Edmond knows a lot about dinosaurs.

20
00:01:06.072 --> 00:01:07.812
He is a clever-clogs. 

21
00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:10.972
But we've got better than real dinosaurs.

22
00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:14.502
We've got singing dinosaurs. 

23
00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:18.492
We are the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs.

24
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:22.802
We are the dinosaurs. Listen to us sing. 

25
00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:27.402
They are a bit small. 

26
00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:30.672
Yes, aren't dinosaurs meant to be big?

27
00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:34.212
Ah, yes! We do have a big dinosaur.

28
00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:37.722
A real vampire. 
Erm, would you like to meet it?

29
00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:39.252
Yes, please. 

30
00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:43.622
These are its footprints.
 We just have to follow them. 

31
00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:45.082
Woo!

32
00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:49.002
These footprints look very real.

33
00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:53.312
Are you sure there is no living 
dinosaurs about, Grampy Rabbit?

34
00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.412
Quite sure, Daddy Pig. 

35
00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:57.912
Over the boulders, everyone. 

36
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.822
Across the bridge. 

37
00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:06.182
Through the cave. 

38
00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:12.312
Oh, the footprints have stopped. 

39
00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:16.012
Look! There are some green steps. 

40
00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:22.595
It's a big slide. Wee!

41
00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:29.385
Wee!

42
00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:35.725
Wow! It's a big dinosaur. 

43
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:42.075
Yes, it's my mopping ginormous dinosaur slide. 

44
00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:46.055
Aha ha ha. 

45
00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:49.209
That is some dinosaur. 

46
00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.873
He is a Plateosaurus. 

47
00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:56.283
Actually, the correct name is Apatosaurus. 

48
00:02:56.383 --> 00:02:58.570
You are a bit of a clever-clogs, aren't you?

49
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.390
Yes.

50
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.200
All right, my little explorers.

51
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.300
Are you ready for the next bit of adventure?

52
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.090
Yes, Grampy Rabbit. 

53
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.110
We have to find an egg. 

54
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.400
An egg? 

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.100
But eggs are little. It could be anywhere. 

56
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.010
Leave it to me. Foxes love hunting for eggs. 

57
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.730
Freddy Fox has a very good sense of smell. 

58
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.310
Wow! What an egg!

59
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.780
It's huge!

60
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.070
Why is the egg so big?

61
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.380
It's a dinosaur egg. 

62
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.770
Is it real?

63
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.580
No, it's better than real.
 It's pretend. Watch this!

64
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.312
Happy birthday! Happy birthday!

65
00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:52.592
The dinosaur egg has a birthday cake inside it. 

66
00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:53.932
Hooray!

67
00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:57.268
It is not a pretend cake, is it Grampy Rabbit?

68
00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:03.808
No, the cake is very real and very tasty.
 Who wants some?

69
00:04:03.908 --> 00:04:05.208
Me! Me!

70
00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:09.048
Birthday boy first! Here you go, Freddy. 

71
00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:12.783
Happy birthday, Freddy. 

72
00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:19.113
Time for the beaten song and dance.
 Everyone, copy me. 

73
00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:20.553
To the stomp. 

74
00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:23.243
To the dinosaur. Stomp!

75
00:04:23.343 --> 00:04:24.433
To the roar!

76
00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.413
To the dinosaur roar! 

77
00:04:26.513 --> 00:04:27.913
Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! 

78
00:04:28.013 --> 00:04:29.643
Roar! Roar! Roar!

79
00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:31.983
To the dinosaur stomp! 

80
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:35.143
Stomp! Roar!

81
00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:41.303
This is my best birthday ever.
