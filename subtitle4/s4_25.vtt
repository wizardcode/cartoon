Erm…Madame Gazelle, I need a toilet. 

21

Oh, Pedro!

22
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.531
Sorry! Er…sorry! Thank you!

23
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:09.451
Quickly, Pedro!

24
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:12.531
I've never been to the theatre before. 

25
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:15.352
It's exciting, isn't it?

26
00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:18.491
Sorry! Er…thank you!

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:22.072
Shhhh…children, everyone quiet now. 

28
00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:27.841
What's that music?

00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:29.751
The show is starting. 

30
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.501
Oh, sorry everyone. 

31
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:37.261
It is not the start of the show.
 It is Madame Gazelle's phone ringing. 

32
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:43.081
Wow! Whose phone is that?

33
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:45.912
That really is the show starting!

00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:54.182
Welcome to the Mr. Potato's Christmas Show,

00:01:55.892 --> 00:02:04.751
Hello, children! I'm Mr. Potato.
 This is Mrs. Carrot. Here is Sweat Cranberry.

37
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:11.901
And here is everyone's favourite
 Christmas vegetable, Little Sprout.

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.472
He he he!

39
00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:15.611
Ha ha ha!

40
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:18.681
Where is Little Sprout gone?

41
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:21.572
Er Little Sprout. Where are you?

42
00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:23.611
He's lost!

43
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.812
Oh~~~~

44
00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:28.282
Can you help us find him, boys and girls?

45
00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.381
Yes! He he he!

46
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:35.581
If you see him, boys and girls, 
shout out "There's Little Sprout".

47
00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:38.282
There's Little Sprout!

48
00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:42.442
That's it! When you see him, shout out that!

49
00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:46.722
There he is! He is behind you!

50
00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.131
Where?

51
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.271
There! Behind you!

52
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.201
I can't see him. 

53
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:56.243
They are not very good at looking, are they?

54
00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.033
Boo!

55
00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:00.943
There you are! You cheeky little sprout! 

56
00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:07.733
I'm the magic Fairy Carrot.
 Look, children. I can fly. 

57
00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.693
There's a string lifting her up. 

58
00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:15.523
I can grant you one wish.
 What do you wish for?

59
00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:18.263
I wish we had a Christmas tree!

60
00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:21.453
Your wish is my command!

61
00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:23.803
Woo!

62
00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:29.833
Now, we can sing our Christmas song. 
Would you like to hear it, boys and girls?

63
00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:30.823
Yes! 

64
00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:38.883
Sweat little sprouts on the Christmas tree.
 Potatoes, carrots and cranberry! 

65
00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:45.923
He's a very special Christmas good, all our friends,
 where the magic of vegetables never ends.

66
00:03:46.023 --> 00:03:48.433
That's the end. Goodbye children.
 Happy Christmas! 

67
00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:50.983
Happy Christmas everybody!

68
00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:55.843
That was a bit quick. 

69
00:03:56.043 --> 00:04:00.103
Wait, there's one more surprise. 

70
00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:06.193
A very important person has come to see you all. 

71
00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:08.273
Ho! Ho! Ho! 

72
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.573
Can you guess who it is?

73
00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:12.183
Ho! Ho! Ho! 

74
00:04:12.283 --> 00:04:13.773
It's the Queen!

75
00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:18.473
It's Father Christmas!

76
00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:19.883
Hooray!

77
00:04:19.983 --> 00:04:24.523
Hello, children! Have you been good?

78
00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:25.553
Yes!

79
00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:28.603
Have you been cleaning your teeth?

80
00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:29.483
Yes!

81
00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:32.643
Have you kept your bedrooms tidy?

82
00:04:32.743 --> 00:04:33.673
Oh~~~ 

83
00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.763
Very good!

84
00:04:35.863 --> 00:04:37.303
Ho! Ho! Ho! 

85
00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:39.223
Merry Christmas!

86
00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:43.343
Now, let's all sing a Christmas song!

87
00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:44.403
Yes!

88
00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:52.313
Sweat little sprouts on the Christmas tree.
 Potatoes, carrots and cranberry! 

89
00:04:52.243 --> 00:04:59.113
He's a very special Christmas good, all our friends,
 where the magic of vegetables never ends.
