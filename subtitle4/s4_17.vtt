1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.620
Bedtime Story

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.109
It is night time. 

8
00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:23.259
Daddy Pig is reading 
Peppa and George a bedtime story. 

9
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.585
And so the prince, the princess, 

10
00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:30.984
the buggy and the frog all lived happily ever after.

11
00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:32.924
 The end!

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.879
The bedtime story has sent Peppa and George to sleep. 

13
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.899
Good night, my little piggies!

14
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.440
George's awake. 

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.950
Dinosaur! Grrrâ€¦

16
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.560
George, you naughty piggy! Go back to sleep. 

17
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.810
George is not sleepy. 

18
00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:03.060
George! Night time is for sleeping, not playing!

19
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:08.290
I can tell you a bedtime story. 

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.450
Once upon a time, there was a little pig.

21
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.290
His name was George Pig. 

22
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.349
And he was off to make his fortune. 

23
00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:24.420
Soon, he came to a forest.

24
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.019
Do you like the story, George?

25
00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.329
Inside the forest was a little house.

26
00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.459
And inside the house was a bowl of porridge.

27
00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:42.650
George Pig was very hungry. 

28
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590
So he ate it all up. Yummy, yummy, yum. 

29
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.536
But just as he finished, Baby Bear walked in, 

30
00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:56.256
and said, "Oy, did you eat my magic porridge?"

31
00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:58.599
George said, "Yes!"

32
00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:05.969
Baby Bear said, "that was magic porridge.
 It will make you go very big."

33
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.030
And then George Pig began to grow. 

34
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.686
He grew and he grew and he grew 

35
00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:18.556
 until he was taller 
than all of the trees in the forest.

36
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.069
The end. 

37
00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.449
Are you sleepy, George?

38
00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.219
No. 

39
00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.620
Not even a little bit?

40
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.620
No!

41
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.389
OK, I'll do a bit more story. 

42
00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.074
Baby Bear said, 

43
00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:38.984
"there is a box of golden treasure 
at the end of the world. 

44
00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:44.244
But it's too far for me to go 
because I am too little."

45
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.379
George said, "I will carry you there."

46
00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:53.794
So George Pig walked to the end of the world. 

47
00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:57.574
He walked and he walked and he walked.

48
00:02:57.674 --> 00:02:59.744
Are you sleepy yet?

49
00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:00.634
No. 

50
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.325
He walked through forests, 
then across mountains, across seas.

51
00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.375
 And are you sleepy yet?

52
00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.159
No!

53
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:15.860
He walked all the way to the end of the world 
and found a big box of golden treasure. 

54
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.560
Woo!

55
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.729
And a big dragon!

56
00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:20.740
Grrâ€¦

57
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:30.330
Yes! A big green dragon, with little wings,
 and breezing fire. Roar!!!!

58
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.129
Luckily it was a very friendly dragon.

59
00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.379
 And he said, "you can have the treasure."

60
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.590
But then, George Pig began to shrink.

61
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.039
He shrank and he shrinked and he shrunk

62
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:51.439
 until he was the same little George Pig
 as he was before. 

63
00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:56.250
"How will we get back home now?" said Baby Bear. 

64
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.099
"I can fly you home." said the dragon. 

65
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:06.078
So George Pig and Baby Bear 
hopped on the dragon's back 

66
00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:13.528
and flew all the way back home 
to the little house in the forest.

67
00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:17.498
 And then it's the end.

68
00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:20.487
George is asleep. 

69
00:04:22.858 --> 00:04:25.317
Peppa is asleep.

70
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.208
Peppa, what are you doing out of bed?

71
00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:32.338
Night time is for sleeping, not playing. 

72
00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:36.730
Night-night, my little piggies.
 Sweat dreams. 

73
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.990
Peppa and George are in their little beds,
 fast asleep.
