00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.531
Pedro the Cowboy

7
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.921
It is a lovely sunny day. 

8
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.521
Pedro has a new play tent. 

9
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:29.161
Here are Peppa, George, Danny Dog,
 Susie Sheep and Wendy Wolf.

10
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.251
Hello, Pedro. 

11
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.671
Howdy, everyone. 
Welcome to my cowboy camp! Ye-ha! 

12
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.581
It's a tent. 

13
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:44.381
It's a cowboy camp 
where cowboys sleep at night time. 

14
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.611
Are you going to sleep in the night?

15
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:52.611
Erm, no! That might be a bit scary.

16
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.241
 But we can pretend it's night time. 

17
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:57.511
But it's not night time. 

18
00:00:57.611 --> 00:01:00.481
Just pretend the sun is the moon. 

19
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:01.551
OK!

20
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:05.431
Petro, can we be cowboys too?

21
00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.751
Yes, you could be my partners.

22
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.001
Is my little cowboy hungry?

23
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:16.121
I sure am, Ma. That's how cowboys speak. 

24
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:19.791
Would you cowboys and cowgirls
 like something to eat, too?

25
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:22.181
Yes, please, Ma. 

26
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:27.331
Did a cowboy always camp 
next to their mummies' kitchen?

27
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:31.831
No. You have to pretend the house is not here.

28
00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:35.561
 This is the Wild West. 

29
00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:36.911
What's that?

30
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:42.261
The Wild West is the land where cowboys live. 

31
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:44.281
What do cowboys do?

32
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:49.371
They tell stories, sing songs, and eat beans. 

33
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:51.881
Beans on toast for everyone!

34
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:53.351
Hooray!

35
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:55.551
Cowboys love beans on toast. 

36
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.661
Everybody loves beans on toast. 

37
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.086
Who wants a cowboy song?

38
00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:03.826
Do you know a real cowboy song?

39
00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:08.206
Yes, I made it up. And it goes like this:

40
00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:14.786
I'm with cowboys and eat my beans,
 with a bing and bong and boo. 

41
00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:21.546
Baked beans bang! Baked beans boo!
 Baked beans bingerly bongerly bang!

42
00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:28.436
Baked beans bang! Baked beans boo! 
Baked beans bingerly bongerly bang!

43
00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:33.456
Let's have a story in the tent. 

44
00:02:34.596 --> 00:02:37.026
I can tell a story. 

45
00:02:37.126 --> 00:02:38.666
Make it scary. 

46
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:45.346
It was a wet and windy night in the Wild West. 

47
00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:46.336
Woo!

48
00:02:46.436 --> 00:02:50.906
And wild animals were out looking for food. 

49
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:54.026
Looking for food, at night?

50
00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:56.656
Some animals eat at night, Susie. 

51
00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:58.486
Wild animals.

52
00:02:58.586 --> 00:02:59.506
Grrrâ€¦.

53
00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:04.236
And the brave cowboy Pedro was alone in his tent. 

54
00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:10.176
But he couldn't sleep, 
because something was outside the tent. 

55
00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.526
Was it a wild animal?

56
00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.576
What's that?

57
00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:17.646
It is a wild animal!

58
00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:19.046
Ahh~~~

59
00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:21.406
Oh!

60
00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:25.066
It is a tiny little bird. 
Come to look at Petro's tent. 

61
00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:32.306
I think it was an eagle. 
Eagles live in the Wild West. 

62
00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:34.076
Is everybody all right?

63
00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:35.416
Yes, Mummy. 

64
00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:37.166
It's nearly home time. 

65
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.626
But we haven't done the pretend sleeping yet.

66
00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:42.766
Everybody back in the tent. 

67
00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:43.806
He he he!

68
00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:46.556
Good night, partners!

69
00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:49.346
Good night, cowboy Petro. 

70
00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:57.926
I'm glad there aren't any wild animals out there. 

71
00:03:58.026 --> 00:03:59.816
Ahooooo!

72
00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:01.246
Wild animals!

73
00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:02.326
Eeeeer!

74
00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:03.816
It's a wolf.

75
00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:06.226
Yes, it's my daddy. 

76
00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:08.316
Ahooooo!

77
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:11.306
Mr. Wolf has come to take Wendy Wolf home. 

78
00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:14.286
All their parents are here 
to pick up the children. 

79
00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.716
Bye-bye, cowboy Petro. 

80
00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:18.556
Bye-bye, everyone.

81
00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.416
Are you coming in, Petro?

82
00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:23.356
I want a pretend sleeping a bit more. 

83
00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:24.186
OK!

84
00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:33.896
Mummy, can I come in now?

85
00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:37.076
Yes, my brave little cowboy.

86
00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:41.326
Even brave little cowboys like
 to sleep indoors sometimes. 

87
00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:42.556
Night, Petro. 

88
00:04:42.656 --> 00:04:44.046
Good night, Ma!
