00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.480
Naughty Tortoise

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.380
It is a lovely autumn day. 

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.360
Peppa and her friends are playing in the leaves. 

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.580
Look, it's Tiddles the Tortoise. 

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.240
Hello, Tiddles, what are you doing here?

11
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.520
Tiddles! Tiddles!

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.660
It is Doctor Hamster, the vet. 

13
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.050
Here is Tiddles. 

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.690
Thank goodness, you've found him.

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.430
Oh, naughty tortoise, back in your box.
 It's your bed time. 

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.810
It's not bed time yet. 

17
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.580
It's bed time for Tiddles.

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.700
He sleeps all through the winter
 and wakes up in spring. 

19
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.440
That sounds nice. 

20
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.680
You like sleeping, don't you, Petrol?

21
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.820
Yes. 

22
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh dear, Tiddles?

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.050
Tiddles has run away. 

24
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.860
Oh!!!

25
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.590
Look, he's on that tree. 

26
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.080
Oh, Tiddles, I don't know 
why you like climbing trees. 

27
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.570
How are we going to rescue Tiddles?

28
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.410
Chop the tree down. 

29
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.850
No. I'll ring the fire brigade.

30
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.570
Fire service! What's that?

31
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.990
Tortoise up a tree? Again? We're on our way. 

32
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.890
Stand clear!

33
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.680
Fire engines use ladders 
to rescue pets from trees. 

34
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.110
Come on, Tiddles. 

35
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.310
Tiddles is climbing higher in the tree. 

36
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.080
Come here, you little pickle. 

37
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.300
Mummy Cow is climbing into the tree.  

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.490
Be careful, Mommy Cow. 

39
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.950
Oh dear, I'm stuck. 

40
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.690
Cows are not very good at climbing trees. 

41
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.020
Hang on, I'm coming up. 

42
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.080
Here, Tiddles. 

43
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.510
Oh, I'm stuck too. 

44
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.310
Elephants are not very good at climbing trees. 

45
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.630
Well, that didn't work, did it?

46
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.970
What are we going to do now?

47
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.170
Chop the tree down!

48
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.480
No!!!

49
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.910
I'll call the next rescue service. 

50
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.940
Hello, Granddad Dog's breakdown service. 

51
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.080
Hello, Tiddles the Tortoise is up a tree. 

52
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.010
Tortoise up a tree? Again?
 Yeah, I'll be right there. 

53
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.570
Mmm, how do you get Tortoises out of trees?

54
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.030
Chop the tree down!

55
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.960
Yes, let's chop the tree down!

56
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.930
No!

57
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.150
OK. I'll climb up instead. 

58
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.430
Hooray!

59
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.990
Oh, I seem to be stuck. 

60
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.820
Dogs are not very good at climbing trees. 

61
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.710
Now, can we chop the tree down?

62
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.530
No! We'll have to call the highest
 rescue service in the land. 

63
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.950
OK, I'm on my way. 

64
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.240
It is Miss Rabbit in her rescue helicopter. 

65
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.180
Hello, everyone! Let's rescue this tortoise!

66
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.120
Err, who's flying your helicopter?

67
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.610
Oops! Silly me! 
I just put the autopilots on. 

68
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.200
Autopilot on. Have a nice day. 

69
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.880
Autopilots fly helicopters on their own.

70
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.330
Got you, you little rascal. 

71
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.280
Miss Rabbit has rescued Tiddles. 

72
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.380
Hooray!

73
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.320
Thank you, Miss Rabbit, for saving my Tiddles. 

74
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.050
No problem.

75
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.430
Thank you for saving us too. 

76
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.630
Just in my job. Goodbye. 

77
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.170
Err. Haven't you forgotten something?

78
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.770
What? Oh, yes. My helicopter! 

79
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.600
Goodbye everyone.

80
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.950
Goodbye!

81
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.640
What a naughty tortoise you are!

82
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.990
Uh-oh.

83
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.070
Oh, good. You're sleeping now.
 Back in your box.

84
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.360
Sleep well, Tiddles. 

85
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.880
Tiddles has gone to sleep for the winter.
 He'll wake again in the spring time. 

86
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.160
Shhhhh!
