1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.190
The Queen 

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.129
Peppa and her family are watching television. 

8
00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.370
And now a special message from the queen. 

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.320
The queen! The queen!

10
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.859
This is the queen. 

11
00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:32.470
Hello to all!

12
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.729
Hello Queen!

13
00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.079
Today I have decided to give an award 
to the hardest working person in the country. 

14
00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:42.960
I wonder who that will be. 

15
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.009
It certainly won't be you, Darling!

16
00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.049
The hardest working person 
in the country is Miss Rabbit. 

17
00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:58.939
Miss Rabbit runs the ice-cream store, 
the recycling center, the library, Shhhh! 

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.590
She drives the train, the fire engine,

19
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.709
 flies a rescue helicopter 
and works the supermarket check-out.

20
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:14.250
Phew! What a long day! 

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.880
Surprise!

22
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.240
Ah, what are you all doing here?

23
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.120
Miss Rabbit, 
I have a very special letter for you. 

24
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.400
Open it!

25
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.959
Miss Rabbit, 

26
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.948
please come to my palace 
to get a medal for all your hard work.

27
00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:33.328
Bring friends. 

28
00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:34.758
All the best! 

29
00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:35.728
The Queen. 

30
00:01:37.048 --> 00:01:39.708
Miss Rabbit has fainted. 

31
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:43.608
I can't visit the Queen. 
I've got too much work to do. 

32
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:47.538
Relax! No one will be working that day. 

33
00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:50.708
The Queen has made it a holiday. 

34
00:01:50.808 --> 00:01:51.898
Hooray!

35
00:01:52.098 --> 00:01:57.457
It is the day Miss Rabbit visits the Queen.
 Peppa and her friends are going too. 

36
00:01:57.503 --> 00:01:59.474
We're off to see the Queen.

37
00:01:59.678 --> 00:02:01.613
We're off  to see the Queen.

38
00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:04.143
ee-ye-yo dio

39
00:02:04.243 --> 00:02:06.093
We're off  to see the Queen.

40
00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.903
Here we are!

41
00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:10.353
This is the Queen's Palace. 

42
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:17.223
Hello! Is anybody there?

43
00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:20.323
Look at all the fusty stuff!

44
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:21.743
Don't touch anything!

45
00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:23.083
Oops!

46
00:02:24.203 --> 00:02:26.863
What a big house!

47
00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:30.773
Lots of room for a Queen to kick a ball about. 

48
00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:32.673
Where is the Queen?

49
00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:36.673
Queen? Queen? Where are you?

50
00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:41.363
Hello! Have you seen the Queen today?

51
00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:45.233
She's an old lady with a crown on her head. 

52
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.493
I am the Queen. 

53
00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:50.633
Miss Rabbit has fainted again.  

54
00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:53.153
Hello, Mrs. Queen!

55
00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:57.063
Why aren't you wearing a crown?

56
00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:00.313
I don't wear it much, 
because it's very heavy. 

57
00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.833
Are you the boss of all the world?

58
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:03.773
Not quite.

59
00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:06.283
Do you tell people what to do?

60
00:03:06.383 --> 00:03:07.223
Sometimes.

61
00:03:07.323 --> 00:03:10.053
Can you make teachers disappear?

62
00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:12.243
Oh, so many question!

63
00:03:12.343 --> 00:03:16.063
The children are very excited to meet you,
 Your Majesty! 

64
00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:21.183
I'm excited to meet all of you!
 And now, for Miss Rabbit's medal! 

65
00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:27.183
This is the Queen's award for industry!

66
00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:28.423
Thank you!

67
00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:32.893
Keep up the good work.
 Three cheers for Miss Rabbit!

68
00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:33.883
Hip, hip!

69
00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:34.983
Hooray!

70
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:35.793
Hip, hip!

71
00:03:35.893 --> 00:03:37.263
Hooray!

72
00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:38.783
Hip! Hip! Hip!

73
00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:40.103
Hooray!

74
00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:43.633
Now for the party!

75
00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:44.953
To the garden. 

76
00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:52.373
You've got a lovely big garden,
 Your Majesty! 

77
00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:54.493
Do you play in it all the time?

78
00:03:54.593 --> 00:03:57.483
I don't have much time for playing. No.

79
00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:58.803
That's sad. 

80
00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:03.853
Oh, dear! A muddy puddle! 
Never mind, we can walk around it. 

81
00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:07.383
You cann't walk around a muddy puddle!

82
00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:08.453
No?

83
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:11.973
No! You have to jump in it.  

84
00:04:13.873 --> 00:04:18.253
Oh, I see. That does look fun.
 Here one goes then. 

85
00:04:18.353 --> 00:04:19.753
Stop!

86
00:04:19.853 --> 00:04:20.673
Ah?

87
00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:27.813
If you jump in muddy puddles, 
you must wear your boots, Your Majesty! 

88
00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.993
Oh dear! The Queen is not wearing her boots. 

89
00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:34.323
Wee!!!

90
00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:39.563
The Queen loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

91
00:04:39.663 --> 00:04:44.453
Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
