00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.739
Perfume

7
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.809
Peppa and George are visiting
 Granny and Grandpa's house.

8
00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.679
Peppa is watching Granny Pig at her dressing table.

9
00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.879
You smell nice, Granny.

10
00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.020
Thank you Peppa. 
It's my perfume de lavender.

11
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.159
It smells like your garden. 

12
00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.869
That is because perfume is made of flowers.

13
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.060
Granny, I've got a very good idea.

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.369
Really?

15
00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.060
Yes. First, I need some water.

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.390
Here's your water.

17
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.810
Right. Now I'm going to put flowers in it,
 and make perfume.

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310
That's nice, dear. 

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.669
But only pick flowers from the grass,
 not from the flower bed, okay?

20
00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:03.700
OK.

21
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.469
Hello, flowers. 
Who wants to be in my perfume?

22
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.739
I'm going to put you in my beaker of water. 

23
00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:21.120
Hello, butterfly. I'm making perfume.

24
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.280
It's going to be the prettiest, 
smelliest perfume, ever. Lovely.

25
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.260
Here is George.

26
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.230
Stand back George. I'm making perfume.
 Do you want to watch?

27
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.469
First I pick a smelly flower. Very flowery.

28
00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.349
Then I put in my beaker.  

29
00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:52.879
No, George. You can't put grass in my perfume. 

30
00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.730
It needs the smell of flowers. Smell.

31
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.730
George does not like smelly flowers.

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.019
Grandpa Pig is in his herb garden.

33
00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.550
Grandpa, Grandpa, smell this. 

34
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.050
It smells like pond water.

35
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.990
It's my special perfume. 
I made it with flowers from the garden.

36
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.539
Oh, yes. 
It's the most beautiful perfume in the world.

37
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.439
Yes.

38
00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.379
Do you like it, George?

39
00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.200
No.

40
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.750
George doesn't like the smell of flowers.

41
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.460
Take this bucket, George.

42
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.310
You can make perfume out of something else.

43
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.750
I have got lots of lovely smelly things
 in my herb garden.

44
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.389
This is rosemary. 
I like to use it in my cooking.

45
00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.610
It smells interesting.

46
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.659
This is mint. 

47
00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.759
That smells very minty.

48
00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.840
And this is lavender.

49
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.750
Oh, that smells like Granny Pig's perfume.

50
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.280
Wow, that's a strong smell of lavender.

51
00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.550
Ah, Granny Pig, you smell nice.

52
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.119
Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

53
00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.960
Granny, Granny, smell this.

54
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.710
What is it?

55
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.000
It's my perfume.

56
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.599
Oh, yes. It's lovely.

57
00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.330
Has George made some perfume, too?

58
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.030
No, Granny. 
He doesn't like the smell of anything.

59
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.939
There must be something you like to smell of.

60
00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.979
George has found a muddy puddle.

61
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.110
Ah, George. What have you got there?

62
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.270
Have you made some perfume?

63
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.979
Actually, that smells quiet nice.

64
00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.069
It smells lovely.

65
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.129
I say, that is delightful. 
What did you put in it, George?

66
00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.230
George's perfume is made out of muddy puddles.

67
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.179
Ah, perfume de muddy puddle!

68
00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:32.000
Wee, ha ha ha ha ha ha!

69
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.239
Granny Pig, 
you smell even nicer than you did before.

70
00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:42.290
Yes, you should use perfume
 de muddy puddle more often.

71
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.122
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
