1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.410
George's Racing Car

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.859
It is a lovely sunny day 
at Granny and Grandpa Pigs' house. 

8
00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:29.059
Peppa, George, Daddy and Grandpa are inside,
 watching racing cars on television.

9
00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:34.070
Come on, Car No.2.

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.150
It's Rick and Nick coming up to the finish.

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.779
What a lot of noise!

12
00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.199
This is so exciting, Car No. 2 is a fastâ€¦

13
00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.839
Ah!

14
00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:44.900
That's better.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.060
The race was almost finished.

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619
Switch it back on!

17
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.280
Wow, that was an exciting and rare race.

18
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.049
I'm so glad I didn't miss the finish.

19
00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.929
See, it's finished.

20
00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:01.460
It's such a lovely day. 
You should all go outside and play.

21
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.690
Yes, Granny Pig.

22
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.940
So, what are we going to play?

23
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.962
George wants to play racing cars.

24
00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:17.312
I know, let's build George a racing car.

25
00:01:17.612 --> 00:01:21.332
Can you really make a racing car, Daddy?

26
00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:23.972
No, but Grandpa Pig can.

27
00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:28.382
What? O-O-OK. 
I'll make a racing car for George.

28
00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:32.842
This is Grandpa Pig's shed
 where he makes things.

29
00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:34.452
What have we got here?

30
00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.092
Ah, an old pram.

31
00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:37.972
No. 

32
00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:40.842
George isn't a baby, Grandpa.

33
00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:43.882
We only need the pram's wheels, Peppa.

34
00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:45.042
Woo!

35
00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.612
This bit can be the bonnet.

36
00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:53.132
And this can be the seats.

37
00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:56.532
What's your favorite number, George?

38
00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:59.422
George's favorite number is two.

39
00:01:59.422 --> 00:02:03.872
Ohh! This racing car will be super fast.

40
00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:04.952
Hooray!

41
00:02:05.052 --> 00:02:08.062
Don't make it go too fast, Grandpa.

42
00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:10.072
George is only little.

43
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.652
Don't worry, Peppa.

44
00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:15.332
This will be a pedal car.
 Not a motor car.

45
00:02:15.432 --> 00:02:16.641
Ahh!

46
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.091
Next, we need a steering wheel.

47
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:25.221
Last of all, 
you need racing goggles and a hat.

48
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:29.511
It's George's racing car.

49
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:35.440
Here are Danny Dog, 
Zoe Zebra, and Pedro Pony.

50
00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:37.024
Hello, everyone.

51
00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:40.114
Look at George's racing car.

52
00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:41.404
Vroom!

53
00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:44.904
Wow! I'll race you. 

54
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:46.634
And me! And me!

55
00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:49.674
I want to race too.

56
00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.934
Where's your racing car, Peppa?

57
00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:54.684
I don't have a racing car.

58
00:02:54.884 --> 00:03:00.074
Don't worry, Peppa. 
You can be the chief mechanic.

59
00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:01.924
What does that do?

60
00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:05.734
You fix George's car, if it goes wrong.

61
00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:06.894
Oh, goody.

62
00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:10.914
I hope it goes wrong a lot.

63
00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:13.754
Let's start the race.

64
00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:16.414
Three times around the garden.

65
00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:19.694
Ready, steady, Go!

66
00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.024
And get off.

67
00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:26.054
Come on George.

68
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:31.273
That's the end of Lap one 
and George is in the lead.

69
00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:35.474
What's all this noise out here?
 I'm trying to watch television.

70
00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:37.644
We're having a race, Granny.

71
00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:43.544
That's the end of Lap two 
and George is still in the lead.

72
00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:47.834
Oh, dear.
 A wheel has come off George's car.

73
00:03:48.234 --> 00:03:50.754
Where's the chief mechanic?

74
00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:52.064
Here I am.

75
00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:53.114
What do we do?

76
00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:55.104
Put the wheel back on.

77
00:03:55.204 --> 00:03:57.344
OK, chief mechanic.

78
00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:59.364
Meow!

79
00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:02.154
Go, George go! 

80
00:04:03.254 --> 00:04:07.564
Oh, dear. 
George is now at the back of the race.

81
00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:10.494
Pedal faster, George.

82
00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:14.004
Come on George.

83
00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:17.534
Come on George.

84
00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:26.314
George is the winner. Hooray!

85
00:04:26.414 --> 00:04:29.094
Well done, George. 

86
00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:33.194
You're the best racing driver
 in the whole world.

87
00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:39.094
And you've got the best chief mechanic
 in the whole world, too.

88
00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:41.434
Yes. That's me!
