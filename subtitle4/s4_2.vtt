1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.899
The New House

7
00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.690
Daddy Pig is working hard in his work room.

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.230
What are you doing, Daddy?

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.850
I'm building a new house.

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.140
It's very small. 

11
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.119
Is it a house for elves and fairies?

12
00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.119
Oh, no. This is a model. 

13
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.970
The real house will be much bigger.

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.780
Ah?

15
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.859
And this is a drawing 
of what needs to be built.

16
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:44.859
I think something is missing, Daddy.

17
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:46.950
There!

18
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.289
Peppa has drawn a swing to go outside the house.

19
00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:51.284
Perfect.

20
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.314
Would you like to visit the new house?

21
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.899
Yes, please!

22
00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.549
Daddy Pig is taking Peppa and George
 to see the house he's building.

23
00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.659
Here we are!

24
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.379
But Daddy, there's nothing here.

25
00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.189
That's because 
the building work hasn't started yet.

26
00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:11.870
Digger! Digger!

27
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.670
Here are Mr. Bull and his friends.

28
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.430
Mr. Bull has come to build the new house.

29
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.969
Aren't you building it, Daddy?

30
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.469
I've done the hard bit. 
Mr. Bull just has to follow my instructions.

31
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:31.619
Hello, Mr. Pig! What is it to be? 
Car park? Swimming pool? Rocket station?

32
00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.329
A house! 
Can you build it exactly like this please?

33
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.849
But bigger.

34
00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:38.709
Mr. Pig wants a house.

35
00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.170
Is it going to be built of straw?

36
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.290
Or sticks?

37
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.980
Or bricks, Mr. Pig?

38
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.469
Bricks, please!

39
00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:46.950
Good choice.

40
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.079
Don't forget the swing!

41
00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.829
Don't worry, Peppa. We won't.

42
00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:58.340
Can I help?

43
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.969
George wants to help too.

44
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.290
OK, George!

45
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.329
Could you put a blob of mortar here?

46
00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.900
It looks like a square of tin mud.

47
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.449
Mortar is a very special kind of mud
 that sticks bricks together.

48
00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.260
Peppa, would you like to lie the first brick?

49
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.849
Yes, please!

50
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.580
Well done! I'll do the rest.

51
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.159
Bricks must be laid straight on level,
 see? Line after line.

52
00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.000
That will take ages!

53
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.389
Yes.

54
00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.270
Will you finish it today?

55
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.090
Oh, no. You can't build a house in a day.
 It'll be finished tomorrow.

56
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.770
Good! See you tomorrow, Mr. Bull!

57
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.869
Bye-bye.

58
00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.990
Bye.

59
00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:58.159
George put the sticky mud down,
 and I put the brick on top.

60
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.229
That all sounds very exciting. 
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.  

61
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.340
It is morning. 

62
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.490
Peppa and George cannot wait to see the new house.

63
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.340
It's finished.

64
00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.770
Almost finished. 
It just needs to be inspected.

65
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.509
Mr. Rabbit is the building inspector.

66
00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:34.199
Very good. But wait! It's not finished.

67
00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:34.679
What?

68
00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.379
You forgot the swing.

69
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.240
Moo!

70
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.270
Oh, no. We didn't.

71
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.150
Thank you, Mr. Bull.

72
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.449
Now it's all ready 
for our new neighbours to move in.

73
00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.819
Neighbours?

74
00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.050
Yes, Peppa. We've got new neighbours.

75
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.860
Mr. Wolf and his family are moving 
into their new home.

76
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.330
Oh, look, little piggies.

77
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.819
Hello, I'm Wendy wolf.

78
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.840
I'm Peppa pig.

79
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.170
Thank you for building our house, Mr. Pig.
 What's it made of, straw, sticks?

80
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.509
It's made of bricks.

81
00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.750
Let's see how strong it is. 

82
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.990
I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll...

83
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.009
Mmm, that is strong. 

84
00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.199
What's your own house made of, Mr. Pig?

85
00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:26.769
Bricks. So don't even think about it!

86
00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.240
Oh, a swing.

87
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.360
That was my idea.

88
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.379
It's very good. You have a go.

89
00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.100
Can you push me?

90
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.950
No, I'll huff and puff instead.
