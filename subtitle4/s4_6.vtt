1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.609
Mr. Fox's shop

7
00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:22.319
Mummy and Daddy Pig are wrapping up a present. 

8
00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.059
Woo! A present! 
Is it for me, or George?

9
00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.029
No, Peppa. It's not for you or George. 

10
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.019
Oh, is it a toy?

11
00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:35.719
No, it's a glass vase. 

12
00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.619
That's a bit of a boring present. 

13
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.819
Oh-uh, it's a present for grown-ups. 

14
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:46.319
We've bought this for Granny and Grandpa Pig.
 It's their wedding anniversary. 

15
00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:49.179
Can me and George buy them a present, too?

16
00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:54.099
That's very sweat of you Peppa, 
but presents can cost a lot of money. 

17
00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.679
We've got money in our piggy bank. 

18
00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.799
Peppa and George have one penny and two buttons to spend. 

19
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.699
OK, let's go shopping. 

20
00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.409
This is Mr. Fox's shop. 

21
00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.389
Hello, there! Can I help you?

22
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:16.409
It's Granny and Grandpa Pig's 
wedding anniversary. 

23
00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.009
There're both very old. I need a present.  

24
00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.429
My shop has everything. 
I'm sure you'll find something you like. 

25
00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:31.569
A big teddy! I love it. 
This can be the present. 

26
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:35.699
Peppa, the present is not for you. 
It's for Granny and Grandpa. 

27
00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.129
Oh, yes.

28
00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.799
Oh, look. Funny teeth. 

29
00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.569
They are wind-up joke teeth, very popular. 

30
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.829
Can they be the present for Granny and Grandpa?

31
00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.469
I think Granny and Grandpa 
have all the teeth they need, Peppa.

32
00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.489
Do your Granny and Grandpa 
like gardening and digging?

33
00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:57.349
Yes. 

34
00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:01.789
Then why not get them a bucket and spade each. 

35
00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.099
 Buy one, get one free.

36
00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:08.479
They've already got spades and buckets
 and hoes and everything. 

37
00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:09.429
Oh dear. 

38
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.969
I know. Grandpa likes sailing his boat. 

39
00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.649
Sailor more.

40
00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.189
I have everything a sailor could ever wish for. 

41
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.209
Do you have pirates' treasure?

42
00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:24.483
Errâ€¦everything except pirates' treasure.

43
00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.213
Oh.

44
00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:27.963
Do Granny and Grandpa like antics?

45
00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:30.213
What does anticy mean?

46
00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:33.950
Antic means old and rare. 

47
00:02:34.063 --> 00:02:38.643
Usually yes. But my antics are grand new. 

48
00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:41.850
That chair comes in save twelve. **
 Nice, isn't it?

49
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.220
Is it made of oak?

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.280
Yes, it's made of plastic oak.

51
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.830
Is it comfortable?

52
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.733
You mustn't sit on it. 
Antic chairs are not for sitting on. 

53
00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:54.563
So, what do you do with them?

54
00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:55.633
You look at them. 

55
00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:59.523
That's not much fun, even for a grown-up. 

56
00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:03.593
Buying a present for Granny and Grandpa
 is hard work. 

57
00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:08.403
I don't understand. My shop sells everything.

58
00:03:08.503 --> 00:03:10.883
 There must be something you like.

59
00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:14.993
There is. I like this teddy.

60
00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:18.733
And I think Granny and Grandpa would like it, too. 

61
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.853
Oh-uh! Let's buy the teddy then.

62
00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:24.593
A very good choice. Who's going to pay?

63
00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:30.223
One penny and two buttons. 
Here's your change. One button. 

64
00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:31.963
Thank you, Mr. Fox. 

65
00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:37.393
Peppa and her family have come 
to give Granny and Grandpa Pig their presents. 

66
00:03:37.493 --> 00:03:39.983
Granny Pig. Grandpa Pig.

67
00:03:40.383 --> 00:03:42.313
Hello, my little ones. 

68
00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:44.683
Happy anniversary!

69
00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:48.813
Oh, another glass vase. 

70
00:03:48.913 --> 00:03:53.213
It's a grown-up present. 
That's why it's a bit boring. 

71
00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:56.833
It's lovely. 
We'll put it with our other glass vases. 

72
00:03:56.933 --> 00:04:00.163
George and me bought you a present, too. 

73
00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:03.723
 I hope you like it. 

74
00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:06.843
A teddy bear! For Grandpa and me?

75
00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:09.563
Thank you, Peppa and George. 

76
00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:11.663
He's very good at curdling. 

77
00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:12.913
Does he have a name?

78
00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:15.833
Erm, he's called Eddy the Teddy. 

79
00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:18.553
And what does Eddy like to eat?

80
00:04:18.653 --> 00:04:20.843
Chocolate and broccoli. 

81
00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:25.713
That's the best present we've ever had. 

82
00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:31.513
Oh, but if Eddy's going to live here, 
he'll need children to play with.

83
00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:33.633
We can play with him, Granny. 

84
00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:38.903
And every time you visit us, 
he'll be here for you to play with. 

85
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:40.763
Oh, goody!
