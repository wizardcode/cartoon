1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:17.393
The Wishing Well

7
00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:21.303
Grandpa Pig is showing Peppa and George
 around his garden. 

8
00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:25.383
Here are my cabbages, broccoli, and sprouts. 

9
00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:26.473
Woo!

10
00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:33.293
Potatoes, carrots and beetroots live here.
 And over there, is the fruit. 

11
00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:35.383
What is this, Grandpa?

12
00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:39.033
That, Peppa, is a weed. 

13
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.423
What is a weed?

14
00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:44.723
A weed is a cheeky plant, growing in the wrong spot. 

15
00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:45.653
Oh!

16
00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:53.033
Pull it out and throw it in this bucket.
 There's no room for weeds in my tidy garden. 

17
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.093
Grandpa Pig is very proud of his garden. 

18
00:00:57.193 --> 00:01:01.743
Maybe there's room to grow a little strawberry here. 

19
00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:08.083
In the middle of my carrots? No, Peppa.
 Strawberries belong with the fruit. 

20
00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:12.653
Everything has its place. 
Isn't that right, Granny Pig?

21
00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:15.943
Yes, Grandpa. 
Can we find a little place for this?

22
00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.793
Er…no!

23
00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:19.863
What is it, Granny?

24
00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:24.863
It's a plastic gnome, Peppa.
 And he's going to live in our garden. 

25
00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:28.343
Oh, no! He isn't. There's no room. 

26
00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:30.983
There's plenty of room. What about here?

27
00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:35.433
I can't have that ugly thing looking at me all day!

28
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:39.263
Peppa, George, do you think my gnome looks ugly?

29
00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:42.613
No, Granny. I think he looks cute. 

30
00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:48.453
There, Grandpa. You are outnumbered.
 The gnome stays. 

31
00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:51.183
Ah! And here come the rest of them. 

32
00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:51.993
What?

33
00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:56.703
Mr. Bull is bringing 
Mr. Gnome a truck load of new friends. 

34
00:01:56.803 --> 00:01:57.983
Yippee!

35
00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.793
But gardens are for plants, not plastic. 

36
00:02:02.093 --> 00:02:04.733
Where do you want the gnomes?

37
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.583
We don't want gnomes, thank you!

38
00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:08.133
Oh!

39
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:09.223
Goodbye. 

40
00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:13.853
Naughty Grandpa Pig. Those are Granny Pig's gnomes. 

41
00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:17.873
Oh. It appears we do want gnomes. 

42
00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:19.634
i'll trade off again.

43
00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:23.824
They are lovely. 

44
00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.009
Here is this as well. Cheerio!

45
00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.439
Thanks you, Mr. Bull. Goodbye. 

46
00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.449
Bye-bye. 

47
00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.969
What's this? A giant gnome?

48
00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.069
No, Grandpa. 

49
00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.269
It's a well. 

50
00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.919
What is a well?

51
00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.329
A well, Peppa, is a very deep hole with water in it. 

52
00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:44.069
Woo!

53
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.609
And as it happens, I do need water for my garden.

54
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.509
So a well will be useful. But that is not a well. 

55
00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.649
It's made of plastic and there's no hole. 

56
00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.119
It's beautiful. 

57
00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.559
What's the point of a well without water?

58
00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.229
It's a wishing well. 
You throw a coin into it and make a wish. 

59
00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.549
Can I make a wish, Granny?

60
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.229
Of course, Peppa. Here's a little coin. 

61
00:03:13.529 --> 00:00:00.000
I wish! I wish! I wish! 

62
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.639
Oh, don't tell us what you are wishing for. 

63
00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.419
OK. 

64
00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.739
Finished!

65
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.079
Very good. 

66
00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.329
Granny, do the wishes always come true?

67
00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:28.289
Yes.

68
00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.289
Oh, goodie!

69
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.769
But now it's time for grandpa to take you home. 

70
00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:33.189
Bye-bye, Granny. 

71
00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.089
Bye-bye. 

72
00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.759
Goodbye, my little ones. 

73
00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.459
Grandpa, you are very lucky 
having a wishing well in your garden. 

74
00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:42.989
Do you think so, Peppa?

75
00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:47.619
Yes, you can wish for things whenever you want. 

76
00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.519
Mm…

77
00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:53.919
And the wishes always come true 
because Granny Pig said so. 

78
00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.249
Yes. 

79
00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.009
Do you want to know what I wished for, Grandpa?

80
00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.029
What did you wish for, Peppa?

81
00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.289
I wished that I could have
 a wishing well and gnomes in my garden. 

82
00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.299
Oh, well, I think we can do that. 

83
00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.919
Peppa and George have arrived home. 

84
00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.379
Mummy, Daddy, I made a wish. And it came true. 

85
00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.989
Really? What did you wish for, Peppa?

86
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.059
Lots of gnomes and a wishing well for our garden. 

87
00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.569
Oh!

88
00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.579
Er…Grandpa Pig, 
I don't think we have enough room. 

89
00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:33.419
Nonsense! You've got plenty of room. 

90
00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.839
Er…yes! I suppose so!

91
00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.839
Peppa and George love gnomes and wishing wells.

92
00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.699
Everybody loves gnomes and wishing wells.
