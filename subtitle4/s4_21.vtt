44
00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:06.072
Doctor Hamster!

45
00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:07.512

Ah! What lovely pets you've got! 

48
00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:16.552
That's a happy little fish. What's its name?

49
00:02:16.652 --> 00:02:19.652
It's Goldie. You've met her before. 

50
00:02:19.752 --> 00:02:22.452
She's got a very shiny bowl. 

51
00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:25.882
What is Goldie like doing?

52
00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:29.552
She likes swimming around and going like this. 

53
00:02:29.652 --> 00:02:35.482
Wonderful! And who is this?

This is my sticky insect. 

55
00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:39.042

57
00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:42.152
What does he do?

58
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:43.702
He looks like a stick. 

59
00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:49.472
Amazing! Oh! What kind of animal is this?

60
00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.132
It is a gecko. 

61
00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:52.832
Does he have a name?

62
00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:55.932
Hemidactylus frenatus.  

63
00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:58.462
Edmond Elephant is a clever-clogs. 

64
00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:01.242
Right! And what does he do?

65
00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:01.972

Oooh! Oooh! Oooh! Oooh! Monkey!

70
00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:11.802
Is he meant to be upside down?

71
00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:14.092
Yes, he's asleep. 

72
00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:17.372
Ah, I see. Well, it's lovely. 

73
00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:22.772
I've brought my pet too, Tiddles the Tortoise.

74
00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:25.632
He likes climbing trees and…

75
00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:26.762
Who is the winner?

76
00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:29.692
Yes, who's won the prize?

77
00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:37.412
Now, the prize goes to…Tiddles the Tortoise!

78
00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:42.132
Doctor Hamster has picked her own pet to win the prize. 

79
00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:45.762
That's not fair. It's your own pet. 

80
00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:52.562
Oh, no! This is only the prize for the best tortoise. 

81
00:03:52.662 --> 00:03:58.112

00:04:05.882 --> 00:04:13.122
The prize for the pet 
who looks most like a stick goes to Steven. 

86
00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:14.502
Hooray!

87
00:04:14.602 --> 00:04:18.082
The prize for the best monkey…

88
00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:23.562
Doctor Hamster, he's not a real monkey.
 He's just pretend. 

89
00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:30.202
The prize for the best pretend monkey goes to Monkey.  

90
00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:31.362
Hooray!

91
00:04:31.462 --> 00:04:36.382
But Doctor Hamster, we choose the best pet of all. 

92
00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:43.112
All of them. They're all happy healthy pets.
 They're all lovely.
