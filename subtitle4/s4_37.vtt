1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:18.071
The Holiday House

7
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:22.931
Peppa and her family are flying
 to another country for a holiday. 

8
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.890
We hope you have enjoyed your flight.
 Please fasten your seat belts. 

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.339
This is Captain Emergency speaking.
 We are about to land in Italy. 

10
00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.399
Oh, Italy! That sounds nice. 

11
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.369
The aeroplane has landed. 

12
00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:43.979
Hooray!

13
00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:49.880
Oh dear! 
Peppa has left Teddy on the aeroplane. 

14
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.600
Now, we need a car to drive
 to our holiday house. 

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.140
Here is the place to borrow cars. 

16
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.000
Hello. 

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.089
(意大利语)

18
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:05.829
In Italy, people speak Italian. 

19
00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.769
Oh, erm. we need a car. 

20
00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.436
(意大利语)

21
00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:14.366
Let me handle this. 
I'm an expert at talking. 

22
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:18.916
We need a car. 

23
00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.206
(意大利语)

24
00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:28.126
Not eggs. A car. 
Erm, no. Not flowers. No. 

25
00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:29.826
Broom! Broom!

26
00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:32.146
(意大利语)

27
00:01:32.246 --> 00:01:34.616
Broom! Broom! Beep! Beep!

28
00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:37.446
Well done, George. 

29
00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:38.676
He! He! 

30
00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:40.256
This bag is heavy.

31
00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:45.236
Are you sure we need everything in here,
 Mummy Pig?

32
00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:48.366
Yes, it's all very important. 

33
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:53.176
Are we going to get lost
 like you always do?

34
00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:57.276
No, Peppa. 
The sitenava tells us the way. 

35
00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:00.146
(意大利语)

36
00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:03.416
In Italy, 
the sitenav talks in Italian. 

37
00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:05.326
(意大利语)

38
00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.826
Maybe we don't need the sitenav. 

39
00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:11.066
Erm. Let's go this way. 

40
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:14.686
Remember Daddy Pig, 
this is another country. 

41
00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:16.836
They may drive differently here.

42
00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:22.816
Ho! Ho! Driving is driving, Mummy Pig.
 It can't be that different. 

43
00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:26.216
(意大利语)

44
00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:30.836
Driving in Italy 
is very different to driving at home. 

45
00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:34.516
Hello! Yes, we are on a holiday. 

46
00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:38.076
Daddy, 
why are they beeping their horns at us. 

47
00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.516
I expect they are saying "Hello". 

48
00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:42.796
Can we say "Hello" back?

49
00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.076
Of course we can. 

50
00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:45.576
Hello. 

51
00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:47.086
(意大利语)

52
00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:49.662
Everyone is so friendly here. 

53
00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:56.512
Peppa and her family are on their way
 to their holiday house. 

54
00:02:56.612 --> 00:03:00.112
Ah! We're almost there. 

55
00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:04.212
Yes, I can feel myself relaxing already. 

56
00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:07.862
Teddy! I left Teddy on the aeroplane. 

57
00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:09.922
What?

58
00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.462
We have to go back for Teddy. 

59
00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:13.512
Er.

60
00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:18.052
Oh dear! It is a policeman. 

61
00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:20.222
Hello, officer. 

62
00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:25.247
I don't know what I was doing wrong,
 but I promise I won't do it again. 

63
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:30.671
Good day! I'm returning this young bear.
 He was left on the aeroplane. 

64
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.201
Oh, thank you! 

65
00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.531
Teddy! 

66
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:35.201
Have a lovely holiday. 

67
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.441
Here we are. 

68
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.541
Peppa and her family have arrived
 at their holiday house. 

69
00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:49.401
What have you got in this bag, Mummy Pig?

70
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.431
It's all important stuff for our holiday. 

71
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:58.006
A lovely plant, our computer,
 tinned food, hot water bottles,

72
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.966
some winter clothes in case it gets a bit chilly,
 the telephone. 

73
00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.009
Let's ring Granny and Grandpa. 

74
00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:11.369
Granny and Grandpa Pig are looking after
 Goodie the fish while Peppa is on holiday. 

75
00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.129
Are you sure we are feeding Goodie enough?

76
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.769
I'll just feed her a pinch more. 

77
00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.979
Hello. 

78
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.249
Hello, Granny. 
Can I speak to Goodie please?

79
00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.109
It's Peppa. For you! 

80
00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.779
I miss you too, Goodie. 

81
00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.889
It has been a long day.
 Now it is time for bed. 

82
00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:38.049
Good night my little piggies. 

83
00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:44.141
Peppa and George are fast asleep
 in their holiday house.
