00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.260
Night Animals

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.030
Peppa and George are having a sleepover
 at Granny and Grandpa Pig's house. 

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.910
Grandpa, where are you going?
 It's bedtime. 

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.620
Don't worry, Peppa.

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.710
I'm just going into the garden
 to collect slugs and snails. 

11
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.799
Why?

12
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.710
Grandpa doesn't like slugs and snails,
 because they eat his vegetables. 

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.740
And the best time to find them
 is at night with this torch. 

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.240
Can George and me come too? Please!

15
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.919
OK. Just this once. 

16
00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.079
Put your coats and boots on. 

17
00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.520
Peppa and George are wearing their coats
 and boots over their pajamas. 

18
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.079
You carry the bucket, Peppa.
 And I'll hold the torch. 

19
00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:09.709
Don't stay out too late, Grandpa Pig. 

20
00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.650
OK, Granny Pig. 

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.549
We'll put all the slugs 
and snails in the bucket. 

22
00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.209
Ah! One little snail. 

23
00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:24.230
Two little snails. 

24
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.760
And a slug. Err. Slugs are yaky. 

25
00:01:30.767 --> 00:00:00.000
Grandpa, there's a little animal in your bucket. 

26
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.670
Here are Grandpa Pig's chickens:
 Sara, Gemima, Phoneser and Navel.

27
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.189
Hello, chickens!

28
00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.290
I need to put the chickens to bed. 

29
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179
Night-night, chickens. 

30
00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:45.910
Night-night, chickens. 

31
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.379
Night-night. 

32
00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:52.339
Why aren't the slugs and snails in bed,
 Grandpa?

33
00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.560
Because they are up all night,
 eating my vegetables. 

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.959
Some animals eat in the daytime,
 like my chickens.

35
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.645
And some animals eat at night, like.
Oh! Mr. Fox. 

36
00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.034
Hello, Grandpa Pig. 
Putting your chickens to bed, aren't you?

37
00:02:10.134 --> 00:02:14.194
Oh, yes. Nice and cozy in the hen house. 

38
00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:18.184
Jolly good. Well, I'll be on my way.
 Good night!

39
00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:19.504
Good night!

40
00:02:19.604 --> 00:02:25.009
Now, as I would say, 
some animals eat at night, likeâ€¦

41
00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.199
Oh! Hello?

42
00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:31.664
Grandpa, there's a little animal in your bucket. 

43
00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:38.404
Ha! Ha! Yes, it's a hedgehog. 
They like to eat slugs and snails. 

44
00:02:38.504 --> 00:02:40.284
Hello, hedgehog! 

45
00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:44.064
Oh, he's rolled into a ball. 

46
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:48.064
Yes, Peppa. He's very shy. 

47
00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:52.134
Come out, Mr. Hedgehog. Don't be scared. 

48
00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.604
I like hedgehogs.

49
00:02:54.704 --> 00:03:00.294
They are very good at keeping slugs 
and snails off my lovely lettuce. 

50
00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:03.154
Bye-bye, hedgehog. Bye-bye. 

51
00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:06.884
Are there any more night animals, Grandpa?

52
00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:09.244
Yes, there are moths. 

53
00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:12.174
Woo! They look like butterflies. 

54
00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:15.854
Butterflies that come out at night.

55
00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:20.864
 They like the torch light. 
When it goes off, they leave.

56
00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:24.524
When the light goes on, they come back. 

57
00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:27.024
Can I try?

58
00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:27.804
OK!

59
00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:30.214
Bye-bye, moths. 

60
00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:31.734
Hello, moths. 

61
00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:33.414
Bye-bye, moths. 

62
00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:41.404
And if we leave the torch off, 
we can see another very tiny night animal. 

63
00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:42.354
Where?

64
00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:44.494
Look up at the sky.

65
00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:47.614
Is it a shooting star?

66
00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:51.134
No, that is a firefly. 

67
00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:52.884
Is it on fire?

68
00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:57.424
No, Peppa. It has a tummy that glows. 

69
00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:58.474
Wow! 

70
00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:04.054
Are there any big night animals
 in your garden, Grandpa?

71
00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:08.064
No! Oh, what's that?

72
00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.774
It's a big night animal. 

73
00:04:10.874 --> 00:04:14.394
Ho! Ho! It's Granny Pig. 

74
00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:16.764
There you are!

75
00:04:16.864 --> 00:04:21.604
Granny, Granny, we've been saying hello
 to all the night animals. 

76
00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:25.924
Lovely. But now it's time to say
 good night to them. 

77
00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:28.284
Good night, night animals. 

78
00:04:30.524 --> 00:04:33.974
And it's well pass bedtime
 for you little piggies. 

79
00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:36.204
Yes, Granny Pig. 

80
00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:38.384
Good night, little ones. 

81
00:04:38.484 --> 00:04:40.474
Good night, Granny. 

82
00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:42.584
Good night, Grandpa. Night, night.
