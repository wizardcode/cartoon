1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.059
The Little Boat

7
00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.570
Peppa and her family are going on a picnic.

8
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.719
I love picnics.

9
00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:23.839
Me too.

10
00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.730
The picnic spot is 
on the other side of the river.

11
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.980
Oh, how do we get over there?

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.429
We take a little boat. 
You call it by ring this bell.

13
00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.700
Hello, there!

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.549
It is Grampy Rabbit in his rowing boat.

15
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.829
Would you like to cross the river?

16
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.520
Yes, please!

17
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.359
Oh, stop, Daddy Pig. There's no more room.

18
00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.460
Oh, bye-bye, Daddy. 

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.210
Don't worry. 
I'll come straight back for you.

20
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.130
Bye.

21
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.259
Row, row, row your boat, 
gently down the stream.

22
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.239
If you see a crocodile, 
don't forget to scream.

23
00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:08.450
Ah! Ha ha ha ha.

24
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.429
Picnic spot. Everybody off.

25
00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.469
Thank you Grampy Rabbit.

26
00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:18.010
Daddy Pig is still waiting 
to get across the river.

27
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.730
Hello, Mr. Pig.

28
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.039
Here are the wolf family.

29
00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:22.709
What are you doing here?

30
00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:25.850
We're having a picnic. 
Would you like to join us?

31
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.099
Yes, please, Mr. Pig.

32
00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.879
Ah. All passengers. 
Women and children first.

33
00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.609
Stop! The boat is full.

34
00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:37.330
Oh!

35
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.660
I'll be straight back for you two.

36
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.849
Bye-bye.

37
00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:45.650
Row, row, row your boat, 
gently down the creek.

38
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.659
If you see a big bad wolf, 
don't forget to shriek.

39
00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.079
Ah! He he he he.

40
00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.299
Hello, Peppa!

41
00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.629
Hello, Wendy!

42
00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.515
We're joining in your picnic.

43
00:01:58.615 --> 00:01:59.925
Oh, goody.

44
00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:01.965
But where's Daddy Pig?

45
00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:04.445
I left him with Mr. Wolf.

46
00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:08.605
I'm getting a bit hungry.

47
00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.115
Don't worry. 
We've got the picnic.

48
00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.715
All aboard.

49
00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:17.675
Stop, Mr. Wolf. 
There's not enough room for you.

50
00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:18.925
Oh, dear.

51
00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:24.005
I've got an idea. You wait here, 
Grampy Rabbit and we'll go over.

52
00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:26.625
All right. I could do with the rest.

53
00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:33.025
Mr. wolf and Mr. Pig 
are crossing the river together.

54
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.225
I'm really hungry now.

55
00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.835
Hooray! We're here.

56
00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:41.605
Hello, Daddy. Where's the picnic?

57
00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:42.495
Oh.

58
00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.985
Grampy Rabbit is waiting with the picnic.

59
00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:46.785
I forgot the picnic.

60
00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:50.655
Ha ha ha! 
You got on a picnic without a picnic.

61
00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:53.222
You're right there.

62
00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:56.292
Ah! What about me, Grampy Rabbit?

63
00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.432
No room, Daddy Pig.

64
00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:00.192
I'll come back for you.

65
00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:04.652
It is Mrs. Duck and her friends.

66
00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:06.232
Hello, Mrs. Duck.

67
00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:10.692
If you've come for the picnic, 
you'll have to wait for the little boat, like me.

68
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:15.172
Or, you could just swim across,
 like you're doing.

69
00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:19.832
Here's the picnic can for everybody.

70
00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:21.332
Hooray!

71
00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:24.192
And here are the ducks.

72
00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:28.462
The ducks always turn up 
when we have picnics.

73
00:03:29.562 --> 00:03:33.052
Would you like some cheese, Grampy Rabbit?

74
00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:36.472
Well, I should really be getting back.

75
00:03:36.572 --> 00:03:38.792
Why do lap up a bit of cheese?

76
00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:42.312
I love jelly.

77
00:03:42.412 --> 00:03:44.042
I love sandwiches.

78
00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:45.712
Strawberry!

79
00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:49.262
They've forgotten me!

80
00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:53.592
Here is some cake for Mrs. Duck.

81
00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:59.282
Is cake your favorite? 
It's daddy's favorite too.

82
00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:02.112
Oh, where is daddy?

83
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:03.652
We forgot daddy.

84
00:04:06.302 --> 00:04:11.292
Ahoy, there! 
I've come to take you to the picnic.

85
00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:12.352
Hooray!

86
00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:16.882
Daddy Pig! 

87
00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:19.742
We forgot you.

88
00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.672
But I saved you some jelly.

89
00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:24.392
I saved you sandwich.

90
00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:26.992
And George saved you a strawberry.

91
00:04:27.292 --> 00:04:29.242
How nice of you all.

92
00:04:29.342 --> 00:04:31.072
Is there any cake?

93
00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:33.692
No, we gave it to the ducks.

94
00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:38.082
But look, Mrs. Duck has saved you a worm.

95
00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:41.992
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Duck,

96
00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:45.022
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

97
00:04:45.082 --> 00:04:48.882
Row, row, row your boat, 
gently down the stream/creek.

98
00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:52.992
If you see a big bad wolf, 
don't forget to shriek.

99
00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:54.032
Ah! 

100
00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:55.472
Ha ha ha ha.
