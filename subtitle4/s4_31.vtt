1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.969
The Aquarium

7
00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.520
Peppa is feeding Goodie the fish. 

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.500
Dinner time, Goodie. 

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.219
Oh, Goodie isn't eating. 

10
00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.879
She looks a bit sad. 

11
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.960
I think she is lonely. 
She hasn't got any fish friends. 

12
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.119
Maybe Goodie could visit the aquarium.

13
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.380
What's the aquarium?

14
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
The aquarium is a place 
where there are lots of fish. 

15
00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.189
Shall we go to the aquarium, Goodie?

16
00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.340
That means "Yes"!

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.209
The family have brought Goodie the fish
 to the aquarium. 

18
00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.254
I hope we can find Goodie a friend. 

19
00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:03.684
I'm sure we will, Peppa. 
The aquarium has every type of fish. 

20
00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.644
Hello, Miss Rabbit. 

21
00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:08.444
Hello. How many tickets, please?

22
00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:10.724
Two grown-ups and two children. 

23
00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:14.464
And one of fish, please. 

24
00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:15.894
The fish goes free. 

25
00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:19.504
Does the aquarium have every type of fish?

26
00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:21.914
Oh, yes! Probably. 

27
00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.924
Good! We're looking for a friend for Goodie. 

28
00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:29.564
Well, I hope you find one.
 Enjoy the aquarium. 

29
00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:30.874
Thank you!

30
00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.944
The first room has a tank full of little fish. 

31
00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:35.974
Fishy!

32
00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:40.644
Wow! There are many inns of teeny fish. 

33
00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:44.914
Fish, fish, fish, fish, swim in the sea. 

34
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:49.074
Who will be a fish friend for my fish Goodie. 

35
00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:50.924
Ho! Ho! Ho!

36
00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:55.614
Could any of these be Goodie's friend?

37
00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:59.084
Hmm. no! They are too small. 

38
00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:01.914
Let's see what fish are in the next room. 

39
00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:02.754
OK!

40
00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:06.564
Here is Candy Cat and her family. 

41
00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.104
Hello, Candy. 

42
00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:09.364
Hello, Peppa. 

43
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:11.824
What are you doing here?

44
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.154
We come here all the time. 

45
00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:16.444
It's better than watching TV. 

46
00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:18.144
We like fish. 

47
00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:23.614
We've come to find a friend
 for Goodie the fish. 

48
00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:24.494
Oh!

49
00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:26.094
What's in this tank?

50
00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:28.174
I can't see anything. 

51
00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:32.694
Oh-ho! Daddy Pig, 
there's a fish can frighten you. 

52
00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:33.514
Where?

53
00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:35.204
Woo!

54
00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:38.294
It is a very big fish. 

55
00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:40.034
Wow!

56
00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:43.404
Do you think this fish could be
 a friend for Goodie?

57
00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:46.344
No! It is too big!

58
00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:49.554
Never mind. 
Let's go to the next room. 

59
00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:52.734
What's in this tank?

60
00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.204
Dinosaur! Grrr…

61
00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:58.164
George thinks he has seen a dinosaur. 

62
00:02:58.264 --> 00:03:00.654
It's not a dinosaur, George.

63
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:04.384
It's a funny kind of fish,
 called a seahorse. 

64
00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.874
You know lots about fish?

65
00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.134
Yes! I like fish. 

66
00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:12.574
Can the seahorse be Goodie's friend?

67
00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:17.154
Er…no! It's too dinosaury!

68
00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:18.714
One more room to go!

69
00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:23.804
Oh, what's in this tank?

70
00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:27.714
Nothing! It's just green slime. Erk! 

71
00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:30.614
That green slime is algae. 

72
00:03:30.714 --> 00:03:34.414
There must be some sort of fish in here! Woo!

73
00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:39.844
 There's a fish with big long ears.
 It's a rabbit fish. 

74
00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:43.374
It is Miss Rabbit, 
wearing a diving costume. 

75
00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:44.204
Woo!

76
00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:46.284
She's cleaning the fish tank. 

77
00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:49.194
Miss Rabbit is saying Hello. 

78
00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:52.164
It is difficult to talk under water. 

79
00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:55.864
Hello, Miss Rabbit. 

80
00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:59.264
That was the last fish tank. 

81
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:03.234
Oh, we haven't found a friend for Goodie. 

82
00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:05.144
What's in the next room? 

83
00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:09.204
This is the aquarium café. 

84
00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:12.354
Oh, goody! My favourite room. 

85
00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:15.574
Hello, Peppa. 
Did you find a friend for Goodie?

86
00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:19.354
No! Oh, who's that?

87
00:04:19.454 --> 00:04:24.124
That's just Ginger, my pet gold fish.
 He loves the aquarium. 

88
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:30.974
Ho! Ho! It looks like 
Goodie's found a friend after all. 

89
00:04:31.074 --> 00:04:33.744
Goodie isn't lonely anymore. 

90
00:04:33.844 --> 00:04:35.124
Hooray!

91
00:04:35.224 --> 00:04:40.084
And Goodie can visit Ginger
 any time she wants.
