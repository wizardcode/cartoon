1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.614
Basketball

7
00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.864
It is a lovely sunny day. 

8
00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.844
Peppa and her friends
 are in the school playground. 

9
00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:31.154
Children, today we have a special person
 coming to teach you basketball. 

10
00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:32.064
Woo!

11
00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.794
Hello!

12
00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:37.114
Daddy, it isn't home time yet!

13
00:00:37.214 --> 00:00:40.374
We've got a special teacher coming today. 

14
00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.114
That's me. I'm the coach. 

15
00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:46.014
A basketball teacher is called a coach. 

16
00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:47.044
Woo!

17
00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.814
That's clever, Daddy. 

18
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:51.234
Peppa, call me Coach!

19
00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:53.164
OK, Daddy Coach.

20
00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.734
Does anyone know how to play basketball?

21
00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:56.734
No!

22
00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:03.884
It's fun. You have to run, bounce the ball,
 and throw it through the hoop. 

23
00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.614
Wow!

24
00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:07.244
Easy peasy! 

25
00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:09.764
Oh!

26
00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:12.954
It is not as easy as it looks. 

27
00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:17.404
To play basketball, 
you need to train hard and keep fit. 

28
00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:20.074
Are you fit, Daddy Coach?

29
00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:23.264
Yes, I'm super fit.

30
00:01:23.364 --> 00:01:26.754
But Daddy Coach, you've got a big tummy. 

31
00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.584
This tummy is pure muscle. 

32
00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:36.464
First, I'll teach you how to get the ball
 from here, to here. 

33
00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:38.614
I can do that.

34
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:44.974
No, Danny, you can't use your feet.
 That's football. 

35
00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:46.874
Danny dog likes football. 

36
00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.984
In basketball, you bounce the ball
 with your hands, like this. 

37
00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:54.604
Who wants a go?

38
00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:55.924
Me, me, me!

39
00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:03.594
Susie Sheep is bouncing the basketball
 very carefully. 

40
00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:05.694
Well done, Susie. 

41
00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:07.804
Now, everyone try. 

42
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.824
Everyone is learning how to bounce the ball. 

43
00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:15.714
Now, I'll teach you tackling. 

44
00:02:15.814 --> 00:02:17.454
What's tackling? 

45
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:22.854
Tackling is try to get the ball
 from another player, like this. 

46
00:02:23.154 --> 00:02:25.684
Try get the ball from me, George. 

47
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:29.584
George is very good at tackling. 

48
00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:31.774
Now, throw the ball through the hoop.

49
00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.134
You need just a bit more training there, George. 

50
00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:40.794
Let's have a little practice game. 

51
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.014
Split into two teams. 

52
00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:46.084
Boys against girls. 

53
00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:51.674
The girls are in one team.
 The boys are in the other. 

54
00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:55.424
That's not fair! 
We've got little ones in our team. 

55
00:02:55.524 --> 00:02:58.964
Don't worry, the boys' team will still win. 

56
00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:01.614
Yeah, we're a super team! 

57
00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:09.434
Emily elephant is very good at 
reaching high with her trunk. 

58
00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:13.674
Emily is using her trunk. It's not fair. 

59
00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:17.204
Shh, Peppa. She's on our side. 

60
00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:19.774
Oh yes, that is fair. 

61
00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:21.714
It's not fair. 

62
00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:24.474
We want Emily on our team. 

63
00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:27.044
No, she's on our team. 

64
00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:30.474
Stop arguing! 
You can all then in the same team. 

65
00:03:30.574 --> 00:03:31.374
OK. 

66
00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:35.354
The children are all in one big team. 

67
00:03:35.454 --> 00:03:38.254
Oh, but who will we play?

68
00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:40.424
Erm? Well…

69
00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:41.654
Hello!

70
00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:45.254
The parents have come to take the children home.  

71
00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:48.904
I know! You can play the grown-ups. 

72
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.094
But they are bigger than us. 

73
00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:56.644
Ahhh! But you've been taught basketball
 by Daddy Coach. 

74
00:03:56.744 --> 00:03:59.304
Yes, let's play them. 

75
00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:01.214
We're the children's team. 

76
00:04:01.314 --> 00:04:02.234
Yeah!

77
00:04:02.334 --> 00:04:04.404
We're the grown-ups' team. 

78
00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:05.884
All right!

79
00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:07.944
I'm quite good at kicking it. 

80
00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:10.824
Yes, well, this is basketball. 

81
00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:13.914
You throw the ball through the hoop.

82
00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:16.753
But you can only use your hands. 

83
00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:18.153
Or your trunk.

84
00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:20.093
But not your feet. 

85
00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.443
Ready? Steady? Go!

86
00:04:22.543 --> 00:04:26.492
Mr. Elephant has the ball. Tackled by George. 

87
00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:29.792
Passed to Zoe Zebra. To Richard Rabbit. 

88
00:04:30.913 --> 00:04:34.333
And Peppa…throws it through the hoop. 

89
00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:35.303
Yippee!

90
00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:37.203
The children have won!

91
00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:38.423
Hooray!

92
00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:42.173
All thanks to Daddy Coach.
