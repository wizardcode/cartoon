1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.039
George's New Dinosaur

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.750
George is playing with his favourite toy, Mr. Dinosaur. 

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.870
George loves playing with Mr. Dinosaur.

9
00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.600
Mr. Dinosaur is made of plastic. 

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.200
It is almost impossible to break him. 

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.590
Dinosaur! Grr…

12
00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:46.979
George loves playing with Mr. Dinosaur in the bath. 

13
00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:55.299
At night time, 
George always takes Mr. Dinosaur to bed with him. 

14
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.049
Dinosaur! Grr…

15
00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.409
George, Mr. Dinosaur is broken. 

16
00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.549
Oh. 

17
00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.609
Mr. Dinosaur does not have a tail anymore. 

18
00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.049
Poor George. 

19
00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.370
You have had Mr. Dinosaur a long time. 

20
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.969
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did. 

21
00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.199
Maybe it's about time you got a new dinosaur. 

22
00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.849
Yes, we can go to Mr. Fox's shop tomorrow. 

23
00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.790
This is Mr. Fox's shop. 

24
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.040
Mr. Fox's shop sells everything. 

25
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.720
I'm sure we'll find 
you a lovely new dinosaur here, George. 

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.980
Dinosaur!

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.930
George does not want a new dinosaur. 

28
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.170
Look, George. A big dinosaur. 

29
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.920
Oh! Dinosaur!

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.480
Good morning! Can I help you?

31
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.230
We'd like the dinosaur at the window, please. 

32
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.400
Certainly! 

33
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.390
Good choice. This is the Dino Roar. 


34
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.720
It roars, it walks, and it sings a dinosaur song. 

35
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.560
Dino Roar! Dino Roar! Listen to the Dino Roar! Roar!

36
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.520
Wow!

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.300
Dino Roar!

38
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.280
We'll take it. 

39
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.760
Roar!

40
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.770
George is playing with Dino Roar in the garden. 

41
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.650
Don't play too roughly with Dino Roar, George.

42
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.810
He has moving parts and might get broken. 

43
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.160
George cannot play with Dino Roar in the garden.

44
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.380
George wants to play with Dino Roar in the bath. 

45
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.160
George, if you get Dino Roar wet, he'll stop working. 

46
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.770
George cannot play with Dino Roar in the bath.

47
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.590
It is night time. 
George has taken Dino Roar to bed with him. 

48
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.790
Roar!

49
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.204
Ah!

50
00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:58.734
George! Dino Roar has woken me up.

51
00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:02.504
Maybe Dino Roar should sleep somewhere else. 

52
00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:06.934
George cannot have Dino Roar in his bed at night. 

53
00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:08.884
It is morning. 

54
00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.084
Why is George looking so sad?

55
00:03:13.184 --> 00:03:19.544
George cannot play with Dino Roar 
in the garden, in the bath, or in bed. 

56
00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:23.174
Never mind, George. Dino Roar can still roar. 

57
00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:29.284
Dino Roar! Dino Roar! Listen to the Dino Roar! Roar!

58
00:03:29.384 --> 00:03:30.584
Oh!

59
00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:33.804
I think the batteries must run out, Daddy Pig. 

60
00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:37.704
Already? How many batteries are in here? 

61
00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:40.534
Hundreds and thousands. 

62
00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:44.274
Dino Roar needs lots of batteries to make him roar. 

63
00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:47.164
Oh, what's this?

64
00:03:47.364 --> 00:03:49.274
A trumpet? 

65
00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:55.704
It doesn't work. 

66
00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:57.274
Dinosaur! 

67
00:03:58.714 --> 00:04:03.134
That's not a trumpet, Peppa. 
You found Mr. Dinosaur's tail. 

68
00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:03.964
Oh!

69
00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:07.334
Now, Daddy Pig can mend him.

70
00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:14.074
I'll try. Mmm…
I think it might be quite difficult to mend. 

71
00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:15.594
Oh.

72
00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:18.404
Daddy Pig has mended Mr. Dinosaur. 

73
00:04:18.504 --> 00:04:19.814
Hooray!

74
00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:24.154
Oh-oh, I'm a bit of an expert at mending things. 

75
00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:26.464
George loves Mr. Dinosaur. 

76
00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:29.474
Dinosaur! Grr…

77
00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:35.514
Dinosaur! Dinosaur! Hello, Mr. Dinosaur!

78
00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:37.354
Grr…

79
00:04:38.764 --> 00:04:44.314
Mr. Dinosaur is George's favourite toy
 in the whole world.
