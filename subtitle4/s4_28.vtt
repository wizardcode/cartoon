1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.010
Desert Island

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.809
Peppa and George are at Danny dog's house.

8
00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.370
Captain Dog is telling stories of 
when he was a sailor.

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.469
I sailed all around the world, 
and then I came home again.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.100
But now I'm back for good. 
I'll never get on a boat again.

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.729
Daddy, do you miss the sea?

12
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.810
Well, sometimes.

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.920
It is Granddad dog, Grandpa pig and Gramppy rabbit.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.860
Hello!

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.960
Can Captain Dog come out to play?

16
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.500
What?

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.490
We're going on a fishing trip.

18
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.694
On a boat.

19
00:00:53.794 --> 00:00:55.194
On the sea.

20
00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:56.554
OK. Let's go.

21
00:00:56.654 --> 00:01:00.524
But Daddy, 
you said you'd never get on a boat again.

22
00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:03.404
Oh, yes. So I did.

23
00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:05.424
OK, bye-bye.

24
00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:12.324
Bye. Well, there they go, 
off, on a boat, without me.

25
00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:14.624
What are you going to do now, Daddy?

26
00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:15.714
Oh, I don't know.

27
00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:18.154
Maybe I'll clean the seaweed off the house.

28
00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:21.374
We don't get seaweeds on houses.

29
00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:23.264
No, of course not.

30
00:01:25.134 --> 00:01:27.214
We'll take my boat.

31
00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:31.134
Are you sure your boat's safe,
 Gramppy rabbit?

32
00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:34.984
Of course it's safe, I built it myself.

33
00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:37.504
Oh, we don't need that bit.

34
00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.074
Off we go.

35
00:01:43.014 --> 00:01:45.754
I love going fishing.

36
00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:46.844
Me too.

37
00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:49.504
And what do you need for a fishing trip?

38
00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.124
Fishing rods?

39
00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:54.734
No, the picnic basket.

40
00:01:56.034 --> 00:02:00.024
It's very good of you to steer the boat,
 Gramppy rabbit.

41
00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:04.374
But I'm not steering the boat.
 I thought somebody else was.

42
00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:07.744
Oh, dear. No one is steering the boat.

43
00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:09.824
We're lost at sea.

44
00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:13.934
And look, Gramppy rabbit's boat is sinking.

45
00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:18.344
Don't panic. 
I've been in worse situations than this. 

46
00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:19.594
Really? 

47
00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:22.254
No, this is the worst.

48
00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.154
We are saved.

49
00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.584
But we're stuck on a desert island.

50
00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:35.974
With just sea and the sky for company.

51
00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.544
And we haven't got any food.

52
00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:41.424
I've got a chocolate bar.

53
00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:46.624
Good, we should save the chocolate 
in case we get hungry later.

54
00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:51.504
Oh, dear. 
Gramppy rabbit has eaten all the food.

55
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.134
What a terrible place to be stuck! 

56
00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:57.054
Is anyone else missing cheese?

57
00:02:57.154 --> 00:02:59.874
We've only been here five minutes, 
Gramppy rabbit.

58
00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:04.364
I'm going to put a mark in the sand
 for every time I think about cheese.

59
00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:10.074
We need to call for help.

60
00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:13.944
Call for help, what an excellent idea.

61
00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:20.974
Hel-----p!

62
00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:22.754
What was that?

63
00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:25.704
That was the call of the sea.

64
00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.584
Someone is in trouble.

65
00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:28.944
What can we do?

66
00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:30.774
We'll rescue them.

67
00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:34.654
We can use Granddad dog's boat.

68
00:03:34.754 --> 00:03:39.452
Wait a minute. 
I said I'd never get on a boat again.

69
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.662
But Daddy, they need rescuing.

70
00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:46.572
You're right, just this once.
 I shall sail again.

71
00:03:46.672 --> 00:03:48.662
Life jackets on.

72
00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.482
On, Captain Dog.

73
00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:53.012
Hold, sail!

74
00:03:54.272 --> 00:03:56.612
All our food is gone.

75
00:03:56.712 --> 00:03:58.842
There's nothing left to eat.

76
00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:01.222
There must be something to eat.

77
00:04:02.322 --> 00:04:04.782
Ahoy, there. 

78
00:04:04.882 --> 00:04:07.852
Hooray! We're saved.

79
00:04:08.922 --> 00:04:11.902
Captain Dog has rescued the granddads.

80
00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:14.162
Land ahoy.

81
00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:15.902
Everyone off the boat.

82
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:17.822
Farewell, everybody.

83
00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:19.702
See you in a few weeks.

84
00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:21.502
Daddy, where are you going?

85
00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:26.602
Me? I was just thinking of 
sailing around the world again.

86
00:04:26.702 --> 00:04:29.582
But Daddy, you're not a sailor anymore.

87
00:04:29.682 --> 00:04:31.802
No, of course not.

88
00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:35.802
Leave the sailing to us Captain Dog.

89
00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:40.342
Yes, and when they get lost again,
 you can rescue them.
