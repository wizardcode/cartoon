1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.289
Potato City 

7
00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:21.899
Peppa and her family are going to Potato City. 

8
00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.650
What is Potato City, Mummy? 

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.940
It is a theme park, Peppa. 
Where the magic of vegetables never ends. 

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.320
It sounds a bit boring. 

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.590
It will be fun. Potato City, here we come.

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.579
Here we are. 

13
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.750
The family have arrived at a field of potatoes. 

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.149
Is this Potato City? 

15
00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:47.619
It must be. 

16
00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:49.732
And it looks like we pick the right day to visit. 

17
00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:51.142
There are no crowds.

18
00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:54.049
Are you sure this is the right place,
 Daddy Pig? 

19
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.539
It just looks like a farmer's field to me. 

20
00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.399
Excuse me, is this Potato City? 

21
00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.719
No, that's Potato City. 

22
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.469
It isn't quite what I was expecting. 

23
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.810
It is fantastic! 

24
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.290
How many tickets? 

25
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.480
Two adults and two children please,
 Miss Rabbit. 

26
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.979
Busy, isn't it? 

27
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.439
Busy? No. This is quiet for Potato City.
 Have a lovely day! 

28
00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.849
Peppa's friends have come to Potato City, too. 

29
00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:29.409
Hello everyone. 

30
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.859
Hello Peppa. 

31
00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.419
And this is Mr. Potato himself. 

32
00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:43.819
Welcome to Potato City, 
where the magic of vegetables never ends! 

33
00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:44.689
 Woo! 

34
00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.039
See how vegetables grow! 

35
00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:56.439
Learn how they keep us fit and healthy 
and get shot into space by the potato rocket! 

36
00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.779
Wee! 

37
00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.939
Peppa and her friends are going to
 ride on the potato rocket.

38
00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.399
George wants to ride on the potato rocket too. 

39
00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.569
Are you sure George? It looks a bit high. 

40
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.179
Daddy Pig doesn't like heights. 

41
00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.729
Moo, hurry up Daddy Pig! 

42
00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.189
Oh! I'm not getting on. 

43
00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.049
George is too small to go on his own. 

44
00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.849
Oh, okay. Make it quick. 

45
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.829
Oh, it's very quick. 

46
00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.469
George has changed his mind. 

47
00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.009
Oh dear George, come to Mummy. 

48
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.679
Maybe I'll just get off too. 

49
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.129
Chocks away.

50
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.159
Have fun Daddy Pig! 

51
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:45.320
Aaaaaaaah! Oh, it's stopped. 
Well, I'm glad that's all over. 

52
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.620
Wee! 

53
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.040
Aaaaaaah! 

54
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.040
This is brilliant! 

55
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.230
Wee! 

56
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.970
Everybody off! 

57
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.590
That was fun, wasn't it, Daddy? 

58
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.670
Ohâ€•yes! Lots of fun. 

59
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.840
Mummy, what's that? 

60
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.990
Go round and put your head through that hole. 

61
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.380
Now what happens? 

62
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.640
Susie, you are a tomato! 

63
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.460
Look! I'm a carrot! 

64
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.700
Oh yes! 

65
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.770
And I'm a pumpkin! 

66
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.310
Welcome to the Dinosaur Garden! 

67
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.300
Woo! 

68
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.410
Say hello to my dinosaur friends! 
And don't be frightened. 

69
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.434
They are not real, 

70
00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:41.995
but this is exactly how they would 
have looked walking the earth together. 

71
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.930
No, it's not. 

72
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.980
What? 

73
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.350
Triceratops lived in the Cretaceous period.

74
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.480
Stegosaurus was Jurassic. 
They would not have walked together. 

75
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.180
How do you know that? 

76
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.970
I'm a clever-clogs. 

77
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.480
Anyway, who wants to ride one? 

78
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.970
Me! Me! 

79
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.270
Why have you got dinosaurs in Potato City? 

80
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.170
Eh, because dinosaurs ate potatoes? 

81
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.910
No. 

82
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.540
Anyway, children like dinosaurs. 

83
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.200
Dinosaur! Dinosaur! 

84
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.520
Roll up, roll up!

85
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.410
For the vegetable round about swing thing. 

86
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.250
A vegetable roundabout swing thing!

87
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.620
I like Potato City because it teaches you 
about vegetables and swings you round and round. 

88
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.190
Potato City, where the magic of vegetables never ends! 

89
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.220
Up down up down, altogether now. 

90
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.710
Mr. Potato was rolling around.

91
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.410
Your friends are mine,
 he's happy all the time.

92
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.340
Mr. Potato is coming to town.
