00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.059
Spider Web

7
00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.780
Daddy Pig is hard at work in the study. 

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.149
Daddy Pig, this study is a complete mess. 

9
00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.040
It's not that bad. 

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.449
There are lots of cobwebs. 

11
00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:34.409
I love cobwebs. They give the room character. 

12
00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:38.850
Cobwebs mean spiders and I don't like spiders. 

13
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.390
I do. Spiders catch flies and flies are horrid. 

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.960
Well, as long as I don't have to see a spider. 

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.619
Ah~~~~

16
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.189
A spider! Hello, Mr. Skinny Legs!
 Oh! Where have you gone?

17
00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.409
Find it. I don't want it in the house. 

18
00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.250
Everyone is looking for Mr. Skinny Legs. 

19
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.249
Mr. Skinny Legs is not in the filing cabinet. 

20
00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:06.989
Oh!

21
00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.270
Mr. Skinny Legs is not under the chair. 

22
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.060
Ooh!

23
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.229
Mr. Skinny Legs is not on the table. 

24
00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:14.980
Oh!

25
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.240
I wonder where Mr. Skinny Legs is?

26
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.030
Ah~~~

27
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.109
Oh-oh! It sounds like Mummy has found him. 

28
00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.400
Don't be scared, Mummy. 

29
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.349
Get rid of it. 

30
00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:32.459
OK, we'll take Mr. Skinny Legs into the garden. 

31
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.280
Now, Mr. Skinny Legs 
has got the whole garden to play. 

32
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.069
Bye-bye, Mr. Skinny Legs!

33
00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.230
It is starting to rain. 

34
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.989
Mr. Skinny Legs is running back to the house.

35
00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:49.620
Maybe he doesn't like the rain. 

36
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.870
He's climbing up the water spout. 

37
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.609
Eensey Weensey spider climbed up the water spout. 

38
00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.950
Down came the rain and washed the Weensey out.

39
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.150
Out came the sun shining and dried up all the rain.

40
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
Eensey Weensey spider climbed up the spout again.

41
00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:17.099
I don't want Mr. Skinny Legs in the house,
 Daddy Pig. 

42
00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.210
Let's take Mr. Skinny Legs
 a bit further into the garden. 

43
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.419
There we are! A nice tree for you to live in. 

44
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.219
What is he doing?

45
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.849
He's making a web, Peppa.

46
00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.029
Spiders live in webs and use them to catch flies. 

47
00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.489
Oh, he's very busy. 

48
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.499
Yes. It's hard work building a web.

49
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.529
 That's why you must never ever break one. 

50
00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.969
If you do, the spider has to do all the work again. 

51
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.709
Yes, Daddy. Bye-bye, Mr. Skinny Legs.

52
00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.409
It is bed time. 

53
00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:05.909
I liked watching Mr. Skinny Legs making his web today. 

54
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.029
And tomorrow, he will make another web. 

55
00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.029
Really?

56
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.139
Yes, Mr. Skinny Legs makes a new web every day. 

57
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.829
Where will the new web be, Daddy?

58
00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:21.309
I don't know. We'll find out tomorrow. Good night!

59
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.099
Night-night. 

60
00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:29.099
It is morning. 
Daddy Pig is getting ready to go to work. 

61
00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.179
I don't want to be late. 
I have an important meeting at the office. 

62
00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.869
Daddy, you work very hard. 

63
00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.559
Yes, I do. But not as hard as Mr. Skinny Legs. 

64
00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.849
Bye-bye everyone. See you tonight. 

65
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.109
Stop, Daddy!

66
00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.709
What is it?

67
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.999
You cannot drive the car today. 

68
00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.309
Why not?

69
00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.209
Look!

70
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:57.169
Mr. Skinny Legs has built a web,
 joining the car to the house. 

71
00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.869
Daddy, you said "you must never ever break a web."

72
00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:04.679
Did I?

73
00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.389
Yes, Daddy Pig. 

74
00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.879
If you move the car, you will break the web. 

75
00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.029
But how am I going to get to work?

76
00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.509
Don't worry, Daddy. 
You can borrow my little bicycle. 

77
00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.209
Here you are!

78
00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:21.819
Thank you, Peppa. 

79
00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.049
Daddy Pig is riding Peppa's little bicycle. 

80
00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.469
Have a nice ride to work!

81
00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.099
I will, Peppa. Bye!

82
00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.259
Bye!

83
00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:35.829
Woo! Daddy Pig works very hard. 

84
00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:37.359
Woo!

85
00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.309
But Mr. Skinny Legs works even harder.
