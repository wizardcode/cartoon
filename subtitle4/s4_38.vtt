00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.200
Holiday in the Sun

7
00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:22.252
It is the first morning 
of Peppa and her family's holiday in Italy. 

8
00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:24.502
Ah! Holiday!

9
00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.712
Daddy Pig is up, bright and early. 

10
00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:29.362
I'll just go for a little walk.  

11
00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.132
Ah!

12
00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:35.982
Good morning, Mr. Pig. 
I see you have found the swimming pool. 

13
00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:41.502
This is Signor Goat. 
It is his job to look after the holiday house. 

14
00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:44.722
Daddy fell into water. 

15
00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:46.252
It's not funny. 

16
00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:48.312
It is quite funny, Daddy. 

17
00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:51.792
Ho! Ho! 
I suppose it is a bit funny. 

18
00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:53.762
This is my daughter. 

19
00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:56.032
Hello, I'm Gabriella Goat. 

20
00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:58.662
I'm Peppa Pig. 

21
00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:01.622
Tell us if you need anything at all. 

22
00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:03.952
We'd like to do some sightseeing. 

23
00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:07.972
The village is very pretty.
 I'll show you. 

24
00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:11.542
OK. 
I'll just change out of these wet clothes. 

25
00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:15.312
I don't look like a tourist, do I?

26
00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:16.842
You look perfect. 

27
00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.572
Is everybody ready?

28
00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:20.372
Yes, Daddy Pig. 

29
00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:21.742
Then let's go!

30
00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:26.752
This is Gabriella's village. 

31
00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:33.602
Here is the shop of my untie. 

32
00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:36.192
Can I send a postcard?

33
00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.902
Who is it for?

34
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:34.151
What a lovely relaxing holiday
 we are having. 

35
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:37.531
Oh dear! It's the police. 

36
00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:39.188
Leave the talking to me. 

37
00:03:40.098 --> 00:03:44.488
Hello, officer. I don't know what I did,
 but I won't do it again. 

38
00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:46.708
Mr. Pig, your teddy. 

39
00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:48.038
Teddy!

40
00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:49.488
Thank you. 

41
00:03:49.488 --> 00:03:51.848
Just doing my job. (意大利语)

42
00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:57.298
Peppa and her family have arrived back
 at their holiday house. 

43
00:03:57.398 --> 00:03:58.698
Time for bed. 

44
00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:01.258
Can we ring Goodie the fish, Mummy?

45
00:04:01.358 --> 00:04:02.398
OK. 

46
00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:11.788
I do hope we are feeding Goodie enough. 

47
00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:14.678
Hello?

48
00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:18.338
Hello, Grandpa. Is Goodie all right?

49
00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:20.568
Goodie is fine. 

50
00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:24.758
I sent her a postcard today.
 Has it arrived?

51
00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:29.788
Ho! Ho! Not yet! 
But I'm sure it will get here soon. 

52
00:04:29.888 --> 00:04:33.388
Ah. Night-night Grandpa. 

53
00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:35.358
Night-night Peppa. 

54
00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:36.948
Ah. 

55
00:04:38.808 --> 00:04:44.598
Peppa and George are fast asleep
 in their holiday house.
