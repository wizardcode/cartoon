1
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.845
I'm Peppa Pig.

2
00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:06.700
This is my little brother, George.

3
00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.831
This is Mummy Pig.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.339
And this is Daddy Pig.

5
00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.576
Peppa Pig.

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.839
Grandpa Pig's Train to the Rescue

7
00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.769
Grandpa Pig is taking Peppa and George 
for a ride on his little train, Gertrude.

8
00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.309
I love Gertrude the train. 

9
00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:35.430
And the good thing is, Gertrude has rubber wheels,
 so we don't have to go on train tracks. 

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.060
We can go wherever we like. 

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.229
Grandpa's little train goes Toot, Toot, Toot.
 Toot, Toot, Toot. Toot, Toot, Toot.

12
00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.299
Grandpa's little train goes Toot, Toot, Toot,
 all day long. 

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.020
Miss Rabbit is taking the grown-ups
 to work in her big train. 

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.619
Morning Grandpa Pig. I'll transcend your toy train again. 

15
00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.650
Gertrude is not a toy.
 She's a miniature locomotive. 

16
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.879
Oh, that's nice. Bye. 

17
00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.299
Go faster, Grandpa Pig. 

18
00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.480
I can't! This is as fast as Gertrude goes. 

19
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.780
The big train is going very fast.
 Oh dear! The big train has broken down. 

20
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.569
What's happening? We need to get to work. 

21
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:31.950
Hello, Miss Rabbit. Having trouble with your train?

22
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.099
It's not funny, Grandpa Pig.
 All of my passengers need to get to work. 

23
00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:43.420
You need to get yourself a train 
that doesn't break down, like Gertrude. 

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.609
That's a good idea. Are you get? 

25
00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:47.436
What?

26
00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:49.316
I'm borrowing your train. 

27
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:50.896
All change. 

28
00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:53.796
What am I going to do?

29
00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:56.836
You can stay here and mend the big train. 

30
00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:00.056
Right! I do like mending things. 

31
00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:03.186
Woo what fun! Riding a toy train. 

32
00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:09.126
Gertrude is not a toy. She's a miniature locomotive. 

33
00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:12.286
Of course! All aboard the toy train. 

34
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.466
Can't it go any faster?

35
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:20.126
No, Gertrude is a slow train. 

36
00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:23.866
Mrs. Cow is waiting for the train
 at the next station. 

37
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.346
What's happened to the big train? 
Has it shrunk?

38
00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.706
No, this is a toy train. 

39
00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:36.896
Gertrude is not a toy.
 She's a miniature locomotive. 

40
00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:40.146
Off we go!

41
00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:45.816
Grandpa Pig loves mending things. 

42
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.766
So many interesting bits and bulbs. 

43
00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:52.726
Oh, dear! A traffic jam. 

44
00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:55.766
Gertrude can ride on the grass. 

45
00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:57.436
Of course!

46
00:02:57.536 --> 00:02:59.136
Bye everyone. 

47
00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:03.242
Miss Rabbit is taking a shortcut.
 Pass the duck pond. 

48
00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:04.702
Hello, ducks. 

49
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:07.092
Up the hill. 

50
00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:10.112
Hello, Gertrude. You can make it. 

51
00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:12.012
And to the next station. 

52
00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:15.922
Hello! Where's the big train?

53
00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:21.772
The big train is broken. 
We're riding Grandpa Pig's toy train today. 

54
00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:28.152
Gertrude is not a toy train.
 She's a miniature locomotive. 

55
00:03:28.352 --> 00:03:31.722
Next stop! The end of the line. 

56
00:03:31.822 --> 00:03:36.152
This goes here! And that goes there!

57
00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:39.892
Grandpa Pig has mended the train. 

58
00:03:39.932 --> 00:03:41.932
Good as new. 

59
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:48.152
Last stop! 
Now you can all do your important work. 

60
00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:52.872
Hang on! It's taken so long to get here.
 It's home time. 

61
00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:54.982
Oh, back we go then. 

62
00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:59.872
But if we travel on Gertrude,
 it'll take ages to get home. 

63
00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:05.782
Hello, everyone. I've mended the big train. 

64
00:04:05.882 --> 00:04:09.682
Excellent, Grandpa Pig. All change. 

65
00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.982
Off we go. 

66
00:04:12.082 --> 00:04:18.832
Stop! What about Gertrude?
 We can't leave her behind. 

67
00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:21.162
Yes, Gertrude!

68
00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:25.722
Don't worry! We can take the toy train as well. 

69
00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:29.082
Gertrude is not a toy.

70
00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:33.882
We know! She's a miniature locomotive.

71
00:04:35.302 --> 00:04:41.542
Gertrude is the best train in the whole wide world.
