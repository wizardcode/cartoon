00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.500
Peppa and her friends are at playgroup.

2
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Today children,

3
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
we are going to learn about instruments

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.200
that you shake,rattle and bang.

5
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.300
Hooray!

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.449
First, choose an 
instrument each from the music room.

7
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.844
I've got drums!

8
00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:41.922
They are called bongo drums, Danny.

9
00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:44.698
You bang them with your hands like this.

10
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200
I've got a flat bongo drum.

11
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.600
That is a bodhran.

12
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
It is Irish.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.300
You beat it with a little stick like this.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
I've got a tambourine!

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.200
Very good, Pedro!

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.500
You can also shake it like this.

17
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.300
Woo!

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.200
I've got a big drum.

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.600
Ah! The bass drum.

20
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.200
I don't know
 what this is called. But it's scrappy.

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.900
That, Candy, is called a guiro.

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.100
And it comes all
the way from the South America!

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.200
Wow!

24
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.100
How did it get here?

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.200
I brought it back from my holiday.

26
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
What are these?

27
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.500
They are maracas.

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.100
I brought them 
back from my holiday in Spain!

29
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.000
This is a triangle.

30
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.100
My dad sells these in boxes of ten.

31
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.800
Thank you, Freddy. I will remember that.

32
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.700
You don't need
 to go on holiday to get them.

33
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.000
Thank you!

34
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.400
What are these?

35
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.900
These are castanets.

36
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.500
My dad sells them in boxes of five.

37
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.330
Thank you, Freddy.

38
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.065
That is how you play the castanets.

39
00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:09.838
Here you are, Emily.

40
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.848
Do I have to do the dance?

41
00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:15.755
Ha-ha, no! Just
  make the clickety-clack noise.

42
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.607
Ah! I see Rebecca has cymbals.

43
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.400
Yes!

44
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.004
Now you know 
what your instruments sound like.

45
00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:28.296
We can play them all together. 

46
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Ready Steady Go!

47
00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:34.424
Stop! Stop! Stop!

48
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.200
That is not music.

49
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.185
That is just noise.

50
00:02:38.186 --> 00:02:40.400
Anybody can bang, bang, bang.

51
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.617
But to make music,

52
00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:45.900
you have to listen
 to each other and keep in time.

53
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.700
Madame Gazelle, 
I can't listen and do music.

54
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.800
Can you clap?

55
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.300
Yes.

56
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.800
If you can clap, you can make music.

57
00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.700
All the girls, please copy me.

58
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.700
Now, boys.

59
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.200
Madame Gazelle has
made the clapping into music.

60
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.000
And, stop.

61
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Now, we will learn how
 to play our instruments together.

62
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.600
The parents have 
come to pick up the children.

63
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.200
Ah! You are just in time!

64
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.200
May I present the Shake, 
Rattle and Bang Orchestra.Hooray!

65
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.100
Children! Ready, steady, go!

66
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.100
Bravo!

67
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.800
Perhaps some of my
 old pupils would like to join in too.

68
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.500
Find your instruments, children.

69
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.600
Yes, Madame Gazelle!

70
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.300
Madame Gazelle 
used to teach all the mummies and daddies

71
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.834
 when they were little.

72
00:03:57.058 --> 00:04:01.400
It's quite hard, daddy.
But you do it like this.

73
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.164
Let me see if I've got that right.

74
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.800
Daddy, you can play the drum!

75
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.232
I'm a bit of an expert in drumming.

76
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.700
That's good shake, 
rattle and banging. Now perform(?)!

77
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
My daddy can shake, rattle and bang!
