00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.934
Daddy pig is making
vegetable soup for lunch.

2
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.500
Daddy, can I help?

3
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.900
Thank you, peppa. Can you clear
away all these vegetable peelings?

4
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.500
Ok.

5
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.148
Stop, peppa. Vegetable
peelings don’t go in the normal bin.

6
00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:42.362
They go in this brown bin.

7
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.600
Ooh

8
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.700
Banana

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.800
That’s right, george. It’s a banana skin.

10
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.800
And there are onions and carrots and all
sorts of fruit and vegetable leftovers in here.

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.700
Granny and grandpa will like these

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.900
Do granny and grandpa
pig eat potato peelings?

13
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.800
Hahaha. No, peppa.

14
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.600
They’re for grandpa’s garden.
They help his plants grow.

15
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.800
Oh!

16
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100
We can take these round there after lunch.

17
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600
Oh, goody.

18
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.000
Hehehe…

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.485
Mummy pig peppa and george
 are taking the vegetable peelings 

20
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:17.724
over to granny and grandpa pigs house.

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.800
We are here.

22
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.700
Hurray!

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
Grandpa pig, grandpa egg.

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.900
We’ve got a special present for you.

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.900
Ah. Vegetable peelings.
Fantastic.

26
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.436
My garden will like these.

27
00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.100
Does your garden eat vegetables?

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.115
Hoho. No peppa. These
peelings are for my compost heap.

29
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.600
What’s that?

30
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.400
I’ll show you. Here it is.

31
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.300
It’s a wooden box.

32
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.064
Yes, peppa. But it’s a
very clever wooden box.

33
00:01:56.301 --> 00:02:04.440
I put these peelings in the top and then
out of the bottom comes lovely rich earth

34
00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:06.589
Called ‘compost’

35
00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:10.300
How does it do that? Is it a magic box?

36
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.560
Hoho. No, peppa. I’ve got some
little friends that give it some help.

37
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.400
Where?

38
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.200
In here. Look

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.000
Ah. Wriggly worm.

40
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Wiggle, wiggle.

41
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.800
The worms turned all the fruit
and vegetables into compost.

42
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.728
Grandpa, can we find some more
wriggly worms for your composting?

43
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.200
What a good idea!

44
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.200
Come on, george. Let’s find
some more wriggly worms.

45
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.100
A wriggly worm.

46
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.800
Wiggle! Wiggle!

47
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.000
You are a wiggly worm.

48
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.678
How do you do? I love you.
You are a wiggly worm.

49
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.900
Haha! Well done!

50
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.900
Be a good wiggly worm.
And turn it all into compost.

51
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.100
Then, I can use the compost to…

52
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.639
I know, I know. You put a seed
in the ground,cover it in compost

53
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.653
And then it grows into a tree.

54
00:03:20.653 --> 00:03:22.545
Hoho. Yes, peppa.

55
00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:27.126
And talking of trees, we’d
better go and help granny pig.

56
00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:31.480
She’s collecting fruit in the orchard.

57
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.400
What’s the orchard?

58
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.720
It’s where you find fruit trees.

59
00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:38.723
We’ve had this orchard
since i was a little piggy.

60
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.900
Hehe

61
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.700
Hello, granny pig.

62
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.100
Ganny pig.

63
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.200
Are you going to help
me collect some apples?

64
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200
Yes, granny. Oh, the
apples are too high up.

65
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.475
Don’t worry, peppa.

66
00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:55.201
Granny and grandpa have
a little trick to collect the apples.

67
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:57.400
Everybody hold on to the tree

68
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.700
On the count of three,
shake the tree as much as you can.

69
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.000
One, two, three!

70
00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:09.600
It’s raining apples!

71
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.329
Haha

72
00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:16.500
Granny, can we have an apple please?

73
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.900
Of course, peppa.

74
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.800
Mm…delicious

75
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.600
And can you guess what
we do with the apple cores?

76
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.000
Eh..

77
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.800
Wiggle, wiggle!

78
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.700
That’s right. The apple cores go
into the compost for the worms.

79
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.900
Clever george.

80
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.558
And clever wiggly worms, too.
