00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.600
It has been very stormy
weather and the school roof is leaking.

2
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
How can we raise the
money to fix the school roof?

3
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.300
We could have a fun run.

4
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.200
What’s a funny run?

5
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.500
It’s a day for picnics and
giving money to see people run.

6
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.600
The more money you
give, the further they run.

7
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.500
Good idea, daddy pig!
How far can you run?

8
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.900
What? Eh…well,
I can run as far as you like.

9
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
But daddy, you can hardly run at all!

10
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.800
Nonsense! I am an expert at running!

11
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.100
Good. Does anyone else want to run?

12
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.300
No, thank you!

13
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.400
But I will give money
to see daddy pig run!

14
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.500
I do!

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
And me!

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Excellent! Thank you, daddy pig!

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.700
Peppa and her family are eating spaghetti.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.500
Delicious! Is there any more spaghetti?

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.500
Daddy pig!
You’ve already had three things!

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.700
Eating gives me energy

21
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.200
And I need energy for my fun run.

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.900
If you also need a practice running.

23
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.600
What if I practice eating today
then practice running tomorrow?

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800
No, daddy.
You need to practice running now.

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
Oh.

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.200
Come on daddy! Race you!

27
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.000
This is easy.

28
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It is easy to run downhill.
It is hard to run uphill.

29
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300
I don’t think I should’ve
eaten so much spaghetti.

30
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.700
It is the day of the fun run.

31
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.000
Madame Gazelle has a chart to
show how far daddy pig must run.

32
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.200
If daddy pig can run to here.

33
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.400
The supermarket!

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.900
Then to here

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.000
Granddad dog’s garage.

36
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.200
And all the way to here

37
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.100
Windy castle.

38
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.500
Then we will have enough
money to fix the school roof.

39
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
I will do it now. Ready, steady, go! ...

40
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.300
I did it! Now we can have the picnic.

41
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.100
Silly daddy! That is just a drawing.

42
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.000
Yes, now you must
 run to the real windy castle.

43
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:34.300
ow

44
00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:37.300
Ready, steady, go!

45
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.421
hooray!

46
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.155
Come on, daddy pig! You can make it!

47
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.400
Come on, bus! You can make it!

48
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.100
The school bus has
made it to the windy castle.

49
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.300
Now everyone can enjoy the picnic.

50
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.100
Water…water…

51
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.600
What a lovely hot day!

52
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.400
It’s such a relaxing
way to raise money, too!

53
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.100
Water….

54
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.600
Daddy pig has reached the supermarket.

55
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.600
All running makes him very thirsty.

56
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.900
Let’s look through the telescope.

57
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.500
I can see daddy.

58
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.900
The telescope makes everything look closer.

59
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.100
He’s not going very fast.

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.200
Daddy pig has arrived
at Grand daddy dog’s garage.

61
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.000
That’s it. I can’t go on!

62
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.600
Daddy has stopped.

63
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.500
Oh.

64
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.800
You look rather hot.

65
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.100
You need something to cool
you down and give you energy.

66
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.000
Have an ice lolly.

67
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.827
Thank you!
 Granddad dog.  That’s nice…..

68
00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:00.158
a wasp!

69
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.800
Shoo, shoo, get you away, you little pest.

70
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.800
The wasp wants to
share daddy pig’s ice lolly.

71
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.400
No, this is my lolly.

72
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.400
Daddy starts running again, really fast.

73
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.200
Hooray!

74
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.100
Oh..get off…

75
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.700
You can stop now, daddy pig.

76
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700
We have enough
money to fix the school roof.

77
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.500
Ah …

78
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.200
Daddy pig has lost the wasp.

79
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.800
Well done. Daddy pig.

80
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
All that extra running means we’ve got
enough money for a new school bus tool.

81
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.100
Thank you, daddy pig.

82
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.843
You’re most welcome.
