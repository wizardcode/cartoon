00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Peppa's family are on a
holiday in their camp van.

2
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.500
Good morning, my little piggies.

3
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.200
Good morning, Daddy pig.

4
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.500
I love camping.

5
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500
Since we are in the countryside, I thought
we can spend the day looking at nature.

6
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Good idea! Mummy pig.
Let's watch a nature program.

7
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.600
One of the wonders of nature--Birds

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400
How lovely.

9
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Aha aha...

10
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.800
Shoo, shoo, little birdy,
we can't hear our TV.

11
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.667
Oh! Daddy Pig, there is no point being on
a camping holiday and just watching TV.

12
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.587
We can do that at home.

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800
Hum... Good thinking, Mummy Pig.

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.700
There're lots of fun places
we can visit. There's tree world.

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.800
What's tree world?

16
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.800
Tree world is a big forest full of trees.

17
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.600
It sounds a bit boring.

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Or there is potato city?

19
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.900
What's potato city?

20
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.900
There's a tour with potato
fields ending with a potato tasting.

21
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.900
Sounds interesting.

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.000
Or there is Duckland.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.800
What's Duckland?

24
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.200
It's a wide river full of ducks.

25
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.200
Duckland! Let's go to Duckland.

26
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.800
Peppa and George love ducks.

27
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.000
How do we get to Duckland?

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.500
Camp van can guide us.

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.800
Hello! Where are we going today?

30
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.500
Duckland, please.

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.200
Follow the road ahead in a straight line.

32
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.700
Weâ€™re going to Duckland in a camp van.

33
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.500
Welcome to Duckland.
How many tickets please?

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.500
Two adults and two children.

35
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.605
Enjoy the ducks.

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.700
Where are the ducks?

37
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000
Maybe they are on holiday.

38
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Let's have our picnic lunch.
The ducks always turn up...

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.200
When we have picnics.

40
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.700
Peppa and George love picnics.

41
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.400
Look! It's the duck. Stop daddy.
We need bread for the ducks.

42
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.900
Hoho, all right.

43
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.300
Hello Mrs. Duck!

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.400
Here come more ducks.

45
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.300
All the brothers and sisters are here.

46
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.500
And here come more ducks.

47
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.800
It's a Grammy and a Grandpa ducks.

48
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.600
And here are all the aunties and uncles.

49
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.200
That's the last of our picnic gum.

50
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.900
Ducks, say thank you to daddy pig.

51
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.000
You are most welcome.

52
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.900
I love Duckland.

53
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900
It is time to go home.

54
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.100
I wonder what's the shortest way home.

55
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.100
Drive straight ahead into the river.

56
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.300
Oh! Are you sure?

57
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.000
Yes, drive into the river.

58
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.500
But we can't drive in the river.

59
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Yes, it's talking nonsense.

60
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500
Please press the blue button.

61
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.200
The camper van is driving into the river.

62
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.300
Our camper van has turned into a boat.

63
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.200
I wasn't quite expecting that.

64
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
Welcome to the car of the future.

65
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.200
Look! It's granddad dog and Danny dog.

66
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.000
Ahoy, there! Daddy pig.

67
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.631
Ahoy, there.

68
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.314
Sailing on a river in a camper van.

69
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.976
Drive up the next hill.

70
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.785
You have reached your destination.

71
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.700
We are home.

72
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.017
Thank your for your lovely
holiday Mrs. Camper van.

73
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.937
Your are most welcome.

74
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.700
It's nice going on a holiday but it's
nicer to be backing our own little house.

75
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.200
Goodnight my little piggies.

76
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.182
Goodnight.
