00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.300
Peppa and George are
 playing at Zoe Zebra's house.

2
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.100
Little Zuzu and Zaza are
 making a jungle with play-clay.

3
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.000
George has made 
a dinosaur out of play-clay.

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.900
Peppa and Zoe are having a dolls' picnic.

5
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.900
Hello, Mr. Monkey. 
Would you like a cup of tea?

6
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.900
Monkey says yes.

7
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.100
What's the magic word, Mr. Monkey?

8
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400
That means please.

9
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.300
Oh! We haven't got a tea-set.

10
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.000
We could make a tea-set out of play-clay.

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes. George, 
can we use your play-clay please?

12
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
No.

13
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.762
Zuzu, Zaza, we need to
 make a tea-set for our tea party.

14
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.900
No.

15
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.129
You can help us make it.

16
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.200
I'll make the teapot.

17
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.129
And we'll make the cups.

18
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.288
There. Now monkey can have tea. 

19
00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:29.733
Oh! This teapot is too soft.

20
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.100
Real tea-sets aren't soft.

21
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.100
My mummy makes
 real pots. She does pottery.

22
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.900
Mummy, can you help
 us make a tea-set please?

23
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.600
Real teacups and a 
teapot that we can put real water in.

24
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.100
Okay. Come with me.

25
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.000
This is where Ms. Zebra makes her pottery.

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900
Let's make this tea-set.

27
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.300
What's that?

28
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.800
Clay. All pottery starts off like that.

29
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
That is soft, like play-clay.

30
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.287
We need it to be soft, so we can shape it.

31
00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:11.786
 But later it won't be soft.

32
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.065
Mummy Zebra is making
 a little cup on the potter's wheel.

33
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.900
There, one cup.

34
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.800
Wow.

35
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.600
That looks easy.

36
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.800
Would you like to try?

37
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.300
Yes, please.

38
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.538
It's all slimy.

39
00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:38.314
Ah, it's all gone wrong.

40
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.100
Making a cup
 on a potter's wheel is not easy.

41
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.727
There is an easier way to make a cup.

42
00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:49.217
First, roll the clay
 into a long worm like this.

43
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.300
It's a wriggly worm!

44
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.412
I'm a wriggly worm. 

45
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.500
I'm made of clay.

46
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.900
What shall I make today?

47
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.549
I'm a wriggly worm.

48
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.799
We wrap it round and round like this.

49
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920
It's a bit bumpy.

50
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.238
No, I smooth the jolt with my hands

51
00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:16.951
and I add a handle.

52
00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:18.879
It's a cup.

53
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.000
Now we have two cups.

54
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.500
Yes, but a tea-set 
needs more than two cups.

55
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.700
We'll all make cups.

56
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.445
Yes.

57
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.800
Dinosaur.

58
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.114
George has made a dinosaur. 
George always makes dinosaurs.

59
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.453
What a scary dinosaur!

60
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.500
Now we need to bed the tea-set in a kiln.

61
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.668
A kiln is an oven, 
cooks the clay and makes it hard.

62
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800
The tea-set should be ready.

63
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.900
Hooray.

64
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.535
Now we paint them.

65
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.799
The children are painting 
the tea-set lovely bright colors.

66
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.700
The tea-set is finished.

67
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.400
Now we can have our tea party.

68
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.200
There is a cup for everyone.

69
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.600
Oh, we forgot to make a teapot.

70
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.000
I know. 
George's dinosaur can be the teapot.

71
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.092
Yes, let's fill it with water.

72
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.200
This is the best tea-set in the world!

73
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.140
Everybody knows that all the 
finest tea-sets have a dinosaur in them.

74
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.300
Teapot.
