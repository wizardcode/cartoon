00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.800
Mr. Zebra, the postman
 is delivering a letter to Peppa's house.

2
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.300
Oh look, someone's got a party invitation!

3
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.000
It must be for me!

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.900
It says,

5
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.200
To George Pig, from Edmond Elephant

6
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.900
Please come to my party!

7
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.000
Doesn't it say George and Peppa?

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
No. Just George.

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.500
HM... I didn't want to go 
to a silly baby party anyway!

10
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.900
Hello. Oh, it's for 
you Peppa. It's Emily Elephant.

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.800
Hello.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.900
Hello Peppa.

13
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.500
Do you want to come 
to Edmond's party as my friend?

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200
Oh yes please!

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.700
My mummy wants
 us to help with the little ones.

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.500
Help? Yes! I can help!

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.200
Danny and Suzy are helpers too.

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
Oh, goodies!

19
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.200
Everyone is here
 for Edmond Elephant's party.

20
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
Oh the helpers are here.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.700
Hello Mrs. Elephant!

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.500
Let's get this party started!

23
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.300
Who wants to play "Musical statues"?

24
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.400
Yeah!

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.500
This is what you do.

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.200
Dance when the music is playing.

27
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200
And when it stops, freeze like a statue.

28
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.800
Ready. Steady. Go!

29
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.200
Just dance already!

30
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.200
This one is still blinking. You are out!

31
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.200
You're moving George. You are out.

32
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.900
Richard and Edmond are out.

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.200
So Zaza is the winner.

34
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Hurray!

35
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.400
You've got a medal.

36
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400
It's made of real plastic gold.

37
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.100
Mummy, "Musical Statues" is over.

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.100
Lovely! 
Now it's time for "Pass the Parcel".

39
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.800
Yeah!

40
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.400
When the 
music plays, pass the parcel round.

41
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.000
When the
 music stops, take some paper off.

42
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Ready. Steady. Go!

43
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.300
George! Pass the parcel!

44
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.900
Edmond has got a medal.

45
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.000
Hurry up, Richard!

46
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.200
Just take the paper off.

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200
Richard has got a medal.

48
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.600
George has got a medal.

49
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.300
Pass the parcel!

50
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Oh dear, George isn't passing the parcel.

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.500
No, George. That's Zaza's medal!

52
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.200
It's a giant teddy!

53
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.200
Edmond has won!

54
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.200
Mummy, "Pass the Parcel" is finished.

55
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.900
Hm…lovely! Now it's time for food.

56
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.300
Hurray!

57
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.200
Oh…The helpers have taken all the seats.

58
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.700
This is Edmond's party, remember?

59
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.000
The helpers can eat after the little ones.

60
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.700
Oh yes. We're the helpers.

61
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.616
Juice please!

62
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.500
Jelly please

63
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.900
Jelly. Jelly!

64
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.500
More please!

65
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.000
Happy birthday, Edmond!

66
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.700
It is the end of the party.

67
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.400
Thank you, to the helpers.

68
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.200
You've all worked really hard!

69
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.400
Yes…It's not easy
 looking after little children.

70
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.600
Hm… I need to lie down…

71
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.600
I need a holiday…
