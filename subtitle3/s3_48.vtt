00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.400
Daddy pig is getting ready to go to work.

2
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.300
Good, that's all the papers I need. Bye

3
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Byebye Daddy!

4
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.400
Mummy, can we make something?

5
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
Yes ,what would you like to make？

6
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
Dinosaur!

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh, George！

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.800
You always say dinosaur for everything!

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.200
Let's make an aeroplane.

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
George likes aeroplanes.

11
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.800
Can we make an aeroplane that flies?

12
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.900
Yes, all we need is some paper!

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.800
We know where there is the paper.

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.500
There is lots of old paper in the workroom.

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.300
Here's some paper.

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.200
Perfect!

17
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.800
Mummy pig is 
going to make a paper aeroplane.

18
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.200
Fold the paper down the middle.

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.100
Now fold the corners in at one end.

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.200
Fold both corners in again to make a point.

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.800
Then fold the sides back like this.

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.100
Paper aeroplanes.

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.400
Let's see if they can fly!

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700
Ready, steady, go!

25
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.500
Woo~

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
Mummy Pig's
 aeroplane has flown into a tree.

27
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
My turn~Wee~

28
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
Peppa's aeroplane 
has landed in a flower pot.

29
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.500
Your turn, George.

30
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.800
Wee~

31
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.700
George's
 aeroplane is doing a loop-The-Loop

32
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.600
And has landed in a duck pond.

33
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.800
Quack quack

34
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.400
Let's make a big aeroplane.

35
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.800
We will need a really big piece of paper.

36
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.700
Here is a big piece of blue paper.

37
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.000
Peppa and George 
have made a big blue aeroplane.

38
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
Daddy pig!

39
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.000
Hello, everyone.

40
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.400
Shouldn't you be at work?

41
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
Yes, but I've 
forgotten some important papers.

42
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
Daddy, we are making aeroplanes.

43
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.300
We made a really big one.

44
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.700
Wow, fantastic,

45
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.200
You need someone
 big and strong to throw it.

46
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.300
Ready, steady, go!

47
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.000
The big blue aeroplane
 is flying very high and very far.

48
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.700
It just keeps on going!

49
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.600
Bye-Bye, aeroplane.

50
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.400
Hoh~Hoh~Byebye!

51
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Now I need to 
find my important work papers.

52
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Has anyone seen any pieces of paper?

53
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.800
Hmm

54
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.700
Uh, maybe you should follow me.

55
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.800
Is this one of your important papers?

56
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.500
Yes, that's one of them.

57
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.100
Is this one 
of your important papers, Daddy?

58
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.200
Yes, thank you, Peppa.

59
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.400
Hm, why are we at the duck pond?

60
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.800
Oh, I see! Thank you, Mrs. Duck.

61
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.700
The only paper 
I'm missing now is a big blue print.

62
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.000
Hm, is it big and blue?

63
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.200
Like the aeroplane you've 
flown along away and away, Daddy?

64
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200
Oh, hm.

65
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.700
The one that we said bye-Bye to？

66
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.200
Yes, maybe I should ring the office.

67
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400
This is Daddy Pig's office.

68
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.600
Hello, Daddy pig, did you find the papers?

69
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.500
I found some of them.

70
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.900
The only one we need is the big blue print.

71
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.300
That might be a problem.

72
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.000
Daddy threw it away.

73
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.800
Threw it away?

74
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.700
And it flew and flew forever.

75
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.600
Wow, it's here. It just landed on my desk.

76
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.100
What a great idea to make it

77
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.600
Into a paper aeroplane and throw it to us!

78
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.700
Oh, yes. Well.

79
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.200
I am a bit of an expert in throwing things.

80
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.400
Thank you, Daddy Pig.

81
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.400
Now the blue print is delivered.

82
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.500
Daddy Pig can 
take the rest of the day off work.

83
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.000
Ah, that's nice.

84
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.200
Daddy, we need your newspaper.

85
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.300
What for?

86
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.900
Making paper aeroplanes.

87
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.900
Hoh~Hoh~
