00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.000
Daddy, what’s that shirt?

3
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.400
It’s my football shirt.

4
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.100
Daddy’s playing football this afternoon.

5
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.300
Wow!

6
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.003
But first I have to go to work.

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.127

8
00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:41.684

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.400
Poor Daddy, having to go to work.

12
00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.179
Yes, let’s play.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.356
Peppa loves jumping
 up and down in muddy puddles.

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.158
George loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.730
Mummy Pig loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles.

16
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.823
Oh, dear.Mummy! We
 splashed daddy’s football shirt with mud.

17
00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.806
Oh.Don’t worry! We’ll just wash it.

18
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.000
It will be washed in no time.And
daddy won’t know it was ever muddied.

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.707
Let’s find more 
things to put in the machine.

20
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.312
Oh, my dress is a bit muddy.

21
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.300
Mummy Pig and George 
have found more things to wash.

22
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.600
Very good, George.

23
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.600
We put the clothes in here.
And then we switch it down.

24
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.996
The washing machine is
filling up with hot,slippery water.

25
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.890
Splosh. Splosh. Splosh.

26
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.600
The washing machine is
makingthe whole room shake.

27
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.100
Oh, peppa, where’s your dress?

28
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.300
I am washing it.

29
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.300
What? Oh, no.

30
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
Look Mummy,
my red dress is all nice and clean.

31
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.500
Yes, Peppa.But look
what’ it done to everything else.

32
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.100
Oh Dear, Peppa’s white dress
has made all the white clothes pink.

33
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.700
Pink isn't a very 
good color for a football shirt.

34
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.900
Oh.

35
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.400
Daddy Pig is home from work.

36
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.800
Hello, everyone.

37
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.300
Hello, Daddy.

38
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.300
Eh, Daddy Pig, we’ve got
a bit of a problem and mm…

39
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.600
Tell me later, Mummy Pig.
I have to get ready for football.

40
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.400
Now, where’s my football shirt.

41
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.000
Here.

42
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Don’t be silly, Peppa.That’s
one of Mummy’s dresses. It’s Pink.

43
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300
No, Daddy. It’s your football shirt.

44
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.900
It’s got a bit muddy.

45
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.400
So we wash it.

46
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.600
And it all went a bit wrong. Sorry, Daddy.

47
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.900
But I can’t wear a pink football shirt.

48
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.900
Why not, Daddy? Pink is a lovely color.

49
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.300
What do you think George?  yuk.

50
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.801
George does not like pink.

51
00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:38.301
Here are Daddy Pig’s friends,

52
00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:41.801
Mr. Bull, Mr. Rabbit,
Mr. Pony and Mr. Zebra.

53
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.124
Mm! this Daddy Pig comes at
a parade.He'll just be in a moment.

54
00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:48.989
My team are in white.

55
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.282
I need a white shirt.

56
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.392
But Daddy, you have the white shirt.
Just take off your jacket. See?

57
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.700
Fantastic! Thank you, Peppa.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.300

61
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.800
Very smart!

62
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.700
Thank you. Come on, let’s play football.

63
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.000
Yes!

64
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.701
Go!

65
00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:20.702
Hurray!

66
00:04:21.586 --> 00:04:22.348
Hurray!

67
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.200
Daddy, you’ve made your shirt all muddy!

68
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.891
 Of course, Peppa.
Football shirts are meant to be muddy.

69
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Daddy Pig loves playing football.
