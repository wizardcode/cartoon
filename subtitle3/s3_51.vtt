00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.200
It is Christmas Eve.

2
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.700
Hands up! 

3
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.000
Who wants to go and see Father Christmas?

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.900
Me! Me! Me!

5
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.300
Are we going to the North Pole?

6
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.100
Not quite that far, peppa.

7
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.800
But Father Christmas lives at the North Pole!

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Lucky for us, 

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.800
he's got a grotto at the Christmas Fair.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.900
Peppa and George have come to visit Santa's grotto.

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.100
Hello, everyone!

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.200
Hello!

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.600
All aboard the elf train! 

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.200
This way to Santa's Grotto!

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.100
Susie, what are you asking Father Christmas for?

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.000
I don't know! What are you asking for?

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.700
I would like a doll that walks and talks 

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.900
and closes his eyes when it goes to sleep!

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.800
I will ask for that too.

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.500
How does father Christmas remember 

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.900
what toys everybody wants?

22
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
He makes a list!

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.300
His sleigh must be very fast to go 

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.800
around the whole world in one night!

25
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.400
It is a super sleigh!

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
Father Christmas is very old!

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400
He is hundred years of old!

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
Even older than my daddy!

29
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.400
Laughing~

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.500
Santa's grotto!

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.500
Ho, ho, ho, hello everyone!

32
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600
hello, Father Christmas!

33
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.300
Have you all been good?

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.300
Yes!

35
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.500
Have you all kept your bedrooms tidy?

36
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.000
Yes!

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.400
Have you?

38
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.100
Ho, ho, ho, of course!

39
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.800
Now come and tell me what you would like for Christmas?

40
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.500
Woof, woof! Can I have a football, please?

41
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.700
A xylophone!

42
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.600
Giggling wings!

43
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.900
A magic set, please!

44
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.600
Racing car!

45
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
Bouncing ball! ! Ball!

46
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.500
A train, please!

47
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.700
A toy train.

48
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.100
Not a toy train, a real train. 

49
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.300
One I can drive with real passengers.

50
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.300
Ho, ho, I will see what I can do. Is that everyone?

51
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.800
We have not seen you yet.

52
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.400
I am sorry, what is your name?

53
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.600
I am Peppa pig. We have met before!

54
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.700
yes, nice to see you again, peppa! 

55
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.000
What would you like for Christmas?

56
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.200
I would like a doll that walks and talks 

57
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.900
and closes its eyes when it goes to sleep, please!

58
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.700
Eh, the same for me, please!

59
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400
Very good!

60
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.200
You do know where I live, don't you?

61
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.600
Oh, yes.

62
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
How old are you?

63
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.300
I am hundreds of years old.

64
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300
I told you! 

65
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.200
Goodbye, Father Christmas!

66
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.400
Don't forget to leave me a mince pie and……

67
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.600
and a drink, we know!

68
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.300
And carrots for the reindeer!

69
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.500
Ho ho ho!

70
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.200
Peppa and her family are driving back from the Christmas fair.

71
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.600
Daddy, why have we to go back of the car.

72
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.200
We are spending our Christmas at granny and grandpa's house!

73
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.500
But Father Christmas won't know where we are!

74
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Don't worry peppa. Father Christmas knows everything!

75
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.000
Granny pig. It is nearly Christmas!

76
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.200
Yes! And I have got a very important job for you!

77
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.200
Stir the Christmas pudding and make a wish!

78
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
Peppa and George are making a wish!

79
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.800
Racing car!

80
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.300
Oh! Don't tell me what it is!

81
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.100
hehe

82
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.200
Here is mince pie and a drink for Father Christmas!

83
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.200
And a carrot for the reindeer!

84
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.200
The doorbell rings.

85
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.000
Who can that be at this time of night! We are not buying anything!

86
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.500
Merry joyful greetings first happy and cheer

87
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.400
Carol singers.

88
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.800
Merry(?) for you jangling(?) Christmas time's here.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800
Oh, merry Christmas.

90
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.100
It is bed time for peppa and George.

91
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.100
This used to be my bedroom when I was a little piggy. 

92
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.700
Father Christmas knows where granny and grandpa live, doesn't he?

93
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.900
Oh yes, he has been here many times before. 

94
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.500
Good night, Peppa. Good night, George.

95
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.100
Peppa and George have fallen to sleep. 

96
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.100
When they wake up, it will be Christmas day.
