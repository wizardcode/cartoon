00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.431
Peppa and George 
arrived at grandpa pig's house.

2
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.080
Grandpa pig.

3
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.000
What's this? A cuckoo clock?

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Yes, it goes "cuckoo, cuckoo",

5
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.600
but it's broken.

6
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.800
Can you mend it please, grandpa pig?

7
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.300
En. let's take it to my shed.

8
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.100
This is grandpa pig's shed,

9
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.200
where grandpa mends things.

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.633
I'll take a look inside.

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.400
Grandpa, now you've really broken it.

12
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.100
Oh, I wonder if I got a book on clocks.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.738
Ah, here we are-how clocks work.

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.400
Grandpa pig has mended the cuckoo clock.

15
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.900
Hooray.

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.900
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

17
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.200
Mummy pig has come
 to pick up Peppa and George.

18
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.100
Mummy, grandpa's 
mended the cuckoo clock.

19
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.500
That's nice.What's that?

20
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.900
It's my old computer.

21
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
I can't mend that.

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.200
It's not broken.

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
I've got a new computer.

24
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.800
I thought you might like my old one.

25
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.300
Elm, I am not sure I really need one.

26
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Oh, a computer. What does it do?

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.300
You can do letters with it.

28
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.300
Look, granny.A, b, c, d.

29
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.700
And numbers.1, 2, 3.

30
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.600
I am afraid you might 
break it by pressing the wrong button.

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.000
Don't worry, you can't break it.

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Just don't feed it milk or biscuits or jelly.

33
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.941
The best thing
 it does is "Happy Mrs. Chicken".

34
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.846
When you
 press this button, she lays an egg.

35
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500
I am very
 good at it, but George is the best.

36
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.600
That's fun.

37
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.600
Perhaps we should
 keep the computer, granny pig?

38
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.600
Goodbye.Bye bye.

39
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.600
Shall we do some 
work on the computer, granny pig?

40
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.044
Yes, let's do some numbers and letters.

41
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.400
Peppa and her family are having lunch.

42
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.800
I've given my 
old computer to granny and grandpa.

43
00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800
That's nice.

44
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.550
I wonder how they're getting on with it.

45
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.763
Hello, Peppa pig speaking.

46
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.600
Ah, Peppa, I need to ask
 a question about the computer.

47
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.600
It's grandpa. He's broken the computer.

48
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.600
What's the problem
 with the computer, grandpa pig?

49
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.400
It's full of eggs.Eggs?

50
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.400
Happy Mrs.
 Chicken won't lay any more eggs.

51
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.300
I am broken.

52
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.919
Turn the computer off.

53
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.739
Now turn it back on again.

54
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.217
Did that fix it?

55
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.400
I am very broken.

56
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.000
That doesn't sound good.

57
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.100
Maybe it can't be mended.

58
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.257
We'll come around and pick it up.

59
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
Granny, we're here 
to take the computer back.

60
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.100
Oh, grandpa pig has taken it to his shed.

61
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.635
There. That should do it.

62
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.231
I am mended.Hooray.

63
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.000
My grandpa is the best at mending things.

64
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.900
Was it very hard to mend?

65
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.900
Not at all. I found I had this book

66
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.300
How computers work.

67
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.700
So you don't want us
 to take the computer away now.

68
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.600
No. I need it for important work.

69
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.900
For letter and number work?

70
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900
No, to beat granny 
pig's Happy Mrs. Chicken's score.

71
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.500
I laid 4020 eggs.Wow.

72
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.817
So I've got some work to do.

73
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.379
Catching up.
