Teddy playgroup have arrived home.

I hope he was an exciting time with us.

20
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.400
It is Peppa and George’s bed time.

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.061
Everybody, this is Teddy Playgroup.
Hello, he is a special guest.

Can we go to the north pole?

28
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.500
Err…How about the supermarket?

29
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Yes, I don’t think Teddy Playgroup
has ever been shopping before.

30
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.500
It is morning. Peppa is taking 
Teddy Playgroup to the supermarket.

31
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:22.297
This shop sells everything,
oranges, apples, bananas.

32
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.572
Very interesting.

33
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.765
This is the checkout
 where all the food is paid for.

34
00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:34.014
 George wants to take a picture.

35
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.400
Ok, George.

36
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.600
“Cheese”.

37
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.700
Cheese.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.064
Haha. That’s enough pictures, George.

40
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
Teddy Playgroup is missing.

41
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.700
Daddy, you’ve lost Teddy Playgroup.

42
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.900
Hello. How was your day?

43
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.200
Daddy lost Teddy Playgroup.

44
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.390
Oh, no. But I’ve got a plan to find him.

45
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.500
How are we going to
find Teddy Playgroup, Daddy?

46
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.500
First, we print out all
the photos we took of him.

47
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.400
Mummy pig is unpacking the shopping.

48
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.900
Where are you going?

49
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.200
We are going to stick
 pictures of Teddy Playgroup on trees.

50
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
Oh…

51
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.781
Daddy, wait for me.

52
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.585
Why are we sticking 
photos on trees, Daddy?

53
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.600
When people see the
pictures of Teddy Playgroup.

54
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.900
They’ll know he is lost,
and they can help us find him.

55
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.050
Oh, this is Teddy in my bed.

56
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.700
This is Teddy in the kitchen.

57
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.100
And these are George’s
pictures at the supermarket. Ar,

58
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.700
Teddy Playgroup! I know where he is.

59
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.700
Oh, hello?

60
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.300
Mummy, we know
where Teddy Playgroup is!

61
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.075
Yes, he is in the shopping
bag with the pasta and tomatoes.

62
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.200
Peppa is showing her class
Teddy Playgroup’s photo album.

63
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.600
I was worried that Teddy Playgroup

64
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.100
Wasn’t having an
exciting adventure with us.

65
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.240
Then luckily, my daddy
lost him at the supermarket.

66
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.761
But we found him again in the shopping.

67
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.395
That was an exciting adventure!

68
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.911
Yes, it was.
