Oh, yes. It will 
take them ages to find my eggs.

But it was a bit easy.

38
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.600

39
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.002
George, Richard and 
Edmond haven't found any eggs.

40

What are we doing now, grandpa pig?

45

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.325
And around your mouth.

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.415
Did grandpa hide the eggs well?

52
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800
No, we big ones found them easily.

53
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.700
But the little ones needed helping.

54
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.700
George , Richard and Edmod
 don't like to be the little least ones.

55
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.800
Don't worry.

56
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.400

 even littler ones in the garden.

Grandp already told 
us about the baby plants, granny.

59
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000

Can we eat them?

66
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.800
No, Freddie.

67
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.600
These eggs are about to hatch.

68
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.649

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm a little 
chick, singing cheep, cheep, cheep.

74
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.800
I like to pick up 
food with my beak, beak, beak.

75
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.600
