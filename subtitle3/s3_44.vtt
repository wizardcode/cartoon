00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.800
Peppa and her family
are on their way to visit cousin Chloe.

2
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.033
I love playing with big cousin Chloe.

3
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
Chloe…Chloe…

4
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.100
Oh, Chloe.

5
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.900
Hi, there.

6
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.407
These are my friends,
Simon Squirrel and Belinda Bear.

7
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.800
You can call me Si. It's short for Simon.

8
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.700
And I'm Be. It's short for Belinda.

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.800
I'm Peppa.

10
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000
We'll call you Pe.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Oh... And this is George.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.900
We'll call you Ge.

13
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.700
Oh…

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.400
You didn't tell us
you have baby cousins, Chloe.

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.800
I'm not a baby.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
But you are both little.

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000
I am a big girl. George is little.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.800
Eh…Why don't we all play a game?

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.200
Yes. Let's play "Hide and seek".

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
We don't play baby games any more.

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.800
We are almost grown-Up.

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.500
What's about the "Yes/No game"?

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.900
What's the "Yes/No game"?

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.000
I ask things and you answer.

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.600
What makes that a game?

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.500
You mustn't say yes or no.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.900
Too easy.

28
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.800
Do you want to play then?

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.600
Yes.

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.300
A-Ha. You said yes.

31
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.800
That's not fair. I wasn't ready.

32
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800
Be, are you ready?

33
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.900
Yes.

34
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600
A-Ha. I win the game.

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.500
Peppa is very good at
playing the "Yes/No game".

36
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.900
Can I ask the questions?

37
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.200
Of course.

38
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.600
You don't mind
me asking you the questions?

39
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.500
I don't mind.

40
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.400
Am I ever going to
make you say yes or no?

41
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't think so.

42
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.800
Oh… I give up. How do you always win?

43
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.900
Easy. I just don't say yes or no.

44
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.835
Ah, I win.
You said yes and no.

45
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.298
That was fun.

46
00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:17.100
Let's play another game.

47
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.700
Have you ever played "Sardines"?

48
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.900
What's that?

49
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.200
Someone hides
and we all try to find them.

50
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.800
That sounds like "Hide and seek".

51
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
But when you find them,

52
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.900
You keep quiet and hide in the
same space until everyone is hiding there.

53
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.700
Like sardines in a tin.

54
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.600
All right. Let's try it.

55
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.800
George, you hide first.

56
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.900
One, two, three…

57
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.659
George is looking for somewhere to hide.

58
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.685
Nine, ten.  Ready or not, here we come.

59
00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.700
George, I can see your wiggly tail.

60
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.600
Peppa is hiding with George.

61
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.500
Move over, George.

62
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.700
Found you.

63
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.700
Now, Chloe must
squeeze in with Peppa and George.

64
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400
Move up.

65
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
There you all are.

66
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.500
Now, Belinda Bear must squeeze in, too.

67
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.700
Good job.

68
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.200
We're like sardines in a tin.

69
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200
Where's everyone gone?

70
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.372
Surprise.

71
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800
Ah…Can we stop running around now?

72
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.100
Yeah. Let's just chew out.

73
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.900
Chew out? What's that?

74
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.500
We just sit around and talk about stuff.

75
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.700
I like talking. Blah…blah…blah…

76
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.700
Let's talk about music. I dig blue's music.

77
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.600
I like red's music.

78
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600
I like green's music.

79
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600
We don't like children's music.

80
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.300
No, no, no.

81
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.800
What music are you into?

82
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.200
I like this. It's very grown-Up.

83
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.598
Head, shoulders,
knees and toes,knees and toes

84
00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.476
And eyes and ears and mouth and nose…

85
00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:18.345
Head, shoulders,
knees and toes, knees and toes…

86
00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:23.975
Peppa. George. It's time to go home now.

87
00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:27.181
You will see Chloe again soon.

88
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.300
I'm coming
to your house next week, Peppa.

89
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.000
Can we come along, too?

90
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You can come.
But we will be playing games.

91
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.200
We like playing
games with Peppa and George.

92
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.600
Hooray!

93
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.500
You can still have fun playing games

94
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.740
Even when you're almost grown up.
