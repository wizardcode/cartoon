Now, children, do not lose these tickets.

7
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.054
Can I see your tickets, please?

8
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.600
I've lost my tickets.

9
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.900
Oh, dear Pedro, you must be more careful.

10
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.000
There is your ticket.

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400
Try not to lose it again.

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.788
Here comes the train.

13
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
Miss Rabbit is the train driver.

14
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.100
All aboard.

15
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.100
Hooray!

16
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.892
Aho. Here are your activity sheets

17
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.334
The children have to spot
everything that is on the activity sheet.

18
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.800
A boat.

19
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.700
A signal box.

20
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.600
And a tunnel.

21
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.200
I can see trees.

22
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.400
Are trees on the list?

23
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.500
Ah, no.

24
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
I can see clouds.

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200
Are clouds on the list?

26
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.100
No.

27
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.900
I can see Granddad Dog.

28
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.100
Aye hi, there.

29
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.000
Hello, Granddad Dog.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.170
Is Granddad dog on the list?

31
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.700
Silly Peppa, my
granddad won't be on the list.

32
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.200
But he is sailing a boat.

33
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.400
And a boat is on the list.

34
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.600
Hooray!

35
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.678
The children tick the
boat on their activity sheets.

36
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.300
Tickets, please.

37
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.259
Mr Rabbit has come
to check everyone's ticket.

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.300
I think I've lost my ticket.

39
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.500
Oh, dear lord, dear."

40
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.200
Meow, there's your ticket.
Pedro, you are sitting on it.

41
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.832
Now you try not to lose it again, Pedro.

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.872
The train is going slowly uphills.

43
00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:42.983
the train is going quickly down hills.

44
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800
Madam Gazelle. I feel a bit sick,
can I go to the front, please?

45
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.155
Ok, Pedro, you can
go to the front of the train.

46
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.500
Hello, Pedro, not feeling very well?

47
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
Would you like to drive the train for a bit?"

48
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.500
Yes, please.

49
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.200
A signal box,

50
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.300
That's on our list,

51
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.600
Hooray!

52
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.800
The children tick the
signal box on their activity sheets.

53
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.000
The signal has stopped the train so

54
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.592
that someone important could cross.

55
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.408
It's Mrs Duck and her friends.

56
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.900
Oh, we still haven't seen the tunnel.

57
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.500
It's going dark

58
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.400
We're in a tunnel.

59
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.600
The tunnel is the last
thing on the activity sheet.

60
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.000
Hooray!

61
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.405
Last stop.

62
00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:15.006
Wall change, everybody off now.

63
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.600
But Madam Gazelle,
how are we going to get home?

64
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.700
Peppa, we're back where we started.

65
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.627
The train has gone in a big circle.

66
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.836
Tickets, please.

67
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.663
Pedroâ€™s lost his ticket again.

68
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.527
Pedro, can I have my hat back, please?

69
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.090
There's Pedro's ticket.

70
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.591
Oh, that's where I put it.
