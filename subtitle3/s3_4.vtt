00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.400
It is bed time.

2
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.100
Good night Peppa, good night George.

3
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Can I have a story, please?

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.600
Ok. I will read you the Red Monkey book.

5
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.100
But we always have that one,

6
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.100
the Red Monkey has a bath,
cleans his teeth and goes proceed.

7
00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:42.722
Eh …yes,can we do another story.

8
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:50.554
the blue tiger, the green spider,
the orange penguin, oh what’s this one?

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.700
The wonderful world of concrete.

10
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.600
I’ve been looking for that!

11
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.700
Is it your book Daddy?

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.500
It’s a book I borrowed from the library

13
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.700
What’s the library

14
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.500
It’s a place you borrow books from

15
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.642
and when you finish
reading them, you take them back.

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.210
But daddy pig has
forgotten to take this book back.

17
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.784
I have had it for rather a long time.

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.100
Never mind,you can take it back
tomorrow, but now it’s bed time.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.100
After Dad reads this story.

20
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.500
It’s not much of the story, Peppa

21
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.300
please read it, daddy.

22
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.406
Ok. The wonderful world of concrete.

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.658
Concrete is a construction
material composed of sand,

24
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.800
water and chemical
admixtures. Chapter one, sand.

25
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.220
Peppa, George and
Mommy Pig have fallen asleep.

26
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.593
It is the morning, Peppa and her
family have come to the library

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Wow what’s a lot of books

28
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.500
Peppa you 
must be quiet in the library.Why ?

29
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.400
Because people come
here to read and to be quiet.

30
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.300
Next please!

31
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.200
Miss rabbit is the librarian.

32
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400
Hello Mommy Pig, are
you returning these books?

33
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.200
Yes, Miss Rabbit.

34
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.500
Right you are.

35
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100
Why is the computer beeping?

36
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.100
It’s checking to see that you haven’t been
naughty in borrowing the book for too long.

37
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.500
I may have borrowed
this book for a bit too long.

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.500
Don’t worry, Daddy Pig,
it cannot be that bad.

39
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.921
Gosh, Daddy Pig you’ve had
this book out for ten years!

40
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.800
Naughty daddy!  Sorry Miss rabbit.

41
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.100
That’s all right,now
you can borrow another book.

42
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.900
Miss rabbit, can George
and I borrow a book please?

43
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.900
Yes, the children section is over here.

44
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.100
Oh look, fairies, flowers, pretty dresses …

45
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.300
Hello Peppa,Hello, Danny.

46
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.000
I am borrowing book about football

47
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.500
Hello, Peppa!

48
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.200
Hello, Suzy!

49
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.500
I got a book about nursing.

50
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
George has chosen a book
about dinosaurs.Dinosaur, gee!

51
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.575
Look what I’ve found, Further
Adventures in the World of Concrete!

52
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800
Here is a red monkey book.

53
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.200
Not the red monkey book. It’s boring!

54
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.300
But this is a different story.
It might be more fun.

55
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.600
I bet it’s not.

56
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.000
Once upon a time ,
there was a red monkey.

57
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.900
Oh. He had a bath,
 cleaned his teeth and went to bed.

58
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.900
No, he jumped into a 
space rocket and went to the moon.

59
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.239
He had a picnic with the dinosaur,

60
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.886
swam under the sea 

61
00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:05.670
and climbed the highest mountain.

62
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300
That was a busy day. The end.

63
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.600
Wow! Read it again.

64
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.700
We can borrow it
 and read it at home, Peppa.

65
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.700
But I was going to
choose this book or this one.

66
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.200
You can take three
books home if you want, Peppa.

67
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.400
Yippee!

68
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.700
But you must remember
to bring them back on time.

69
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.400
Yes, Miss Rabbit.

70
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.079
And you must remember
to bring your book back, too, Daddy pig.

71
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.271
I’ll make sure daddy remembers.

72
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.400
Yes Peppa .I’m sure you will. Ho ho.
