The rain has made a flood.

10
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Our house is a desert island.

You are my first customers.

56
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.300
Maybe it's because of the flood

57
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.700
Silly, isn't it?

58
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.400
A little bit of rain, and everyone stays at home

59
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.000

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.100
Or we'll have nothing for the dinner!
