00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.015
It is a school day. Peppa and
 her friends are having a music lesson.

2
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.900
Miss Polly had a dolly.

3
00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:33.100
Sorry, Madame Gazelle.

4
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100
Oh dear, Pedro has a cough.

5
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.065
Don’t worry. I’ll ring doctor Brown Bear.

6
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
Doctor Brown Bear, speaking.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Hello doctor, this is Madame Gazelle.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
A child is ill.

9
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.900
Don’t panic. I’ll come straight away.

10
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.700
What seems to be the problem?

11
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.231
I’ve got a cough.

12
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I see. Is it a tickly
cough or a chesty cough?

13
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.500
I don’t know, but it goes like this.

14
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.500
And when did you get this cough?

15
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.900
When Madame Gazelle started singing.

16
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.900
It’s nothing serious,
but Pedro’s cough may be catching.

17
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.700
What do you mean “catching”?

18
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
When one person has a cough,

19
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.700
sometimes other
people get that cough, too.

20
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.600
Do I need medicine?

21
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.100
Just a little spoonful.

22
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.200
I’m afraid it doesn’t taste very nice.

23
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.300
It tastes like an old shoe full of jam.

24
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.700
Thank you Doctor Brown Bear.

25
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.600
Goodbye.

26
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.700
Bye.

27
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700
As I thought, Pedro’s cough is catching.

28
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.300
Dannie Dog and Susie Sheep
have caught Pedro’s cough.

29
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.600
Open wide.

30
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.600
It tastes of cuppet flavored yogurt.

31
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.900
It tastes of flowers.

32
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.200
Well-done for taking your medicine so well.

33
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.400
Do you ever get ill, Doctor Brown Bear?

34
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.400
No, Peppa. I’m never ill.
I eat an apple a day. Goodbye.

35
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.500
Bye.

36
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.800
It is home time,

37
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
and the children’s parents
are here to pick them up.

38
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.900
Mummy, daddy, I’ve got a cough.

39
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.600
Doctor Brown Bear came to look after us.

40
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.100
He gave us horrible medicine.

41
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.100
Madame Gazelle,
can you sing your song now?

42
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.100
Of course, Peppa. (music) Wooo…

43
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.100
Miss Polly had a dolly who was…

44
00:03:05.157 --> 00:03:08.115
Oh, dear, all the grown-ups
have got Petro’s cough.

45
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.800
Doctor Brown Bear speaking.

46
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.700
This is Peppa pig.
All the grown-ups are ill.

47
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.700
Not to worry, Peppa. I’m on my way.

48
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500
Hello, everyone. Caught
Petro’s cough, have we?

49
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.900
Very well. Stand in a line and open wide.

50
00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:43.875
It tastes like custard and old socks.

51
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.100
Thank you for looking after
us, Doctor Brown Bear.

52
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.400
Who looks after you when you’re ill?

53
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.400
No one looks after me. I’m never ill.

54
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.100
Oh, dear. Doctor Brown Bear
has caught Petro’s cough.

55
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.700
Not to worry, goodbye.

56
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.400
Goodbye.

57
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.132
Poor Doctor Brown Bear. He is ill
and there is no one to look after him. Oh.

58
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.300
Who can that be?

59
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.100
Hello, we’ve come to look after you.

60
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.300
Here is some fruit and some cushions.

61
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.400
Here is your medicine.

62
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.400
It tastes like
jammy-yogurt-flavored custard socks.

63
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
And here is a song to
make you feel better. Woooooo…
