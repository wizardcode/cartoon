00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.000
Mummy pig is dressed as a fireman.

2
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.200
Mummy, why are you dressed like that?

3
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.000
I’m going to the
mummy’s fire engine practice.

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.100
wow

5
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.200
This is just a good excuse
for a cup of tea and a chat.

6
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, what are you
doing today, daddy pig?

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.600
I’ve got a very important meeting
with the daddy’s football team.

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.700
That’s just a lot of grown- up
boys kicking a football around.

9
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.000
We are having a barbecue as well.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here are Mr. Bull, Mr. Rabbit,
Mr. Pony and Mr. Zebra.

11
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.700
Moo, is Daddy pig coming out to play?

12
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.500
Come on!

13
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.700
Mummy, can we see the fire engine?

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Yes!

15
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.100
Oh, goodie!

16
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.600
This is Miss. Rabbit’s fire station.

17
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Hello, Peppa and George.
Come and see the fire engine.

18
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
Fire engine!

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.100
There is a ladder for climbing, a hose
for squirting water,and a big bell to ring.

20
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.500
Dingdong dingdong!

21
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
Now, let’s go up to the
tower and look for fires.

22
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.800
Hello, everyone.

23
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.500
Hello, Peppa! Hello, George.

24
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.200
Oh, who’s for a nice cup of tea and a chat?

25
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.100
That sounds nice.

26
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.400
A telephone!

27
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.400
Peppa, that is the fire phone.
It’s only to be used when there is a fire.

28
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.300
Ah, fire! Fire!

29
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.400
Fire station, where is
the fire? Where is the fire?

30
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.900
Can I speak to Mummy pig, please?

31
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.800
Oh, it’s Daddy pig.

32
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.800
Daddy pig, you are not supposed to ring
on this phone.It’s only for emergencies

33
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.400
This is an emergency.I can’t find
the tomato ketchup  anywhere.

34
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.600
Daddy pig, shall I start to barbecue now?

35
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.400
Yes, please, Mr. Rabbit.

36
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.800
Do be careful with the
barbecue, daddy pig.

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.800
Trust me, mummy pig.We daddies
know all about barbecues. Bye!

38
00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:36.727
Maybe it needs more charcoal.

39
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.800
Give it a bit of blow.

40
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.228
Put a few more fire lighters on.

41
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
Now, we just have to wait for a fire.

42
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.100
How long do we have to wait?

43
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.100
Oh, it could be a long time.
I’ve been waiting ages.

44
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.700
How many fires have you
actually put out, Miss Rabbit?

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.400
None, not one fire,
but you’ve got to be ready.

46
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
It’s the fire phone.

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.600
Can you answer it, Peppa?
It’ll probably be your daddy again.

48
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.900
Ok!

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900
Hello, fire station.

50
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.400
Hello, Peppa.

51
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.186
Oh, daddy, it is you! You’re very
naughty. This phone is for fires only.

52
00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.600
Can you put Miss Rabbit on,
please? That’s a good girl!

53
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.500
Daddy wants to speak to you.

54
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.900
Hello, daddy pig. This phone is
only to be used when there is a…

55
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.100
Fire! Fire!

56
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.500
Oh, dear, daddy pig’s barbecue is on fire.

57
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.000
Fire! Fire!

58
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.000
Mummies to the rescue!Wee …

59
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:42.834
Wee …

60
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.000
Hold tight!Wee …

61
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.900
Fire! Fire! Dingdong dingdong!

62
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.400
It’s Miss Rabbit’s fire engine.

63
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.500
Hurray!

64
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.400
Stand back, daddies.

65
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.900
Mummy dog, turn on the water.

66
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.700
Aye, aye, mummy pig!

67
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.500
The fire is out.

68
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.100
Hurray!

69
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.200
Thank you for saving us, Miss Rabbit.

70
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.563
No problem! It’s all part of the
service.  The mummy’s fire engine service.

71
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.495
And now that Miss Rabbit
has kindly flooded our garden.

72
00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:33.405
We can all jump up and
down in muddy puddles.

73
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.700
Yes!

74
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.400
I love fire engines,especially
when they made muddy puddles!
