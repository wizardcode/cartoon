00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.200
It is very early on the Christmas morning. 

2
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
Peppa and her family are staying at 

3
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.800
granny and grandpa pig's house.

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
George, wake up! Santa has been! 

5
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Bubble makers, comics, and tangerines!

6
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.400
Mommy, daddy, it's Christmas!

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.500
Hey, what?

8
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.300
It's too early, peppa.

9
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.300
Go and say "Happy Christmas" to granny and grandpa.

10
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.400
Granny, grandpa!

11
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Ahahah…!!!

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
What a panic! Put hands on …         

13
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.300
It's Christmas! 

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.800
It's three o'clock in the morning!

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.600
But Santa's been. 

16
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.200
Can we see if he is still here?

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.600
No, Santa is not here.

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Look, the carrot, drink and mince pie have gone.

19
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
He has only left crumbs.

20
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.100
Yes, Santa likes the good mince pie.

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.400
And there are big presents under the tree! 

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.000
I asked Santa for a dog. Can we open them now?

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600
We will open the big presents after Christmas lunch.

24
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
Oh, goody!

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.400
Peppa and her family are having Christmas lunch.

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.400
Let's pull the crackers! 

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300
There are paper hats inside.

28
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.800
And party trumpets. 

29
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.200
And jokes! What wobbles in the sky?

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.500
I don't know. 

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
A jetlicopter. 

32
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.300
Mmmm… This Christmas pudding is delicious!

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.800
Peppa and George, helped me make it.

34
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
We did the stirring.

35
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.400
Did you make a wish, Peppa?

36
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.400
Yes. I wished for…

37
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.500
Don't tell us.

38
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.200
Let's open the presents!

39
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.600
Yippee!

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600
This one is for George.

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000
It is a racing car set.

42
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.600
This looks a bit complicated.

43
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.400
Let me see. 

44
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400
This goes here and that goes there and this goes there.

45
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.100
Let's race!

46
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.800
Ready! Steady! Go!

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.000
Daddy and grandpa are enjoying playing racing cars.

48
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Isn't that George's present?

49
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I think George is quite happy playing with the box.

50
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.700
This is your present daddy pig.

51
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.400
Ah, socks!

52
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.500
And I've got, socks!

53
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.400
Socks!

54
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.800
So, the last present must be for…

55
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.500
Me!

56
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.300
I asked Santa for a doll that walks and talks

57
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.300
and closes its eyes when it goes to sleep.

58
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.100
Oh, bird's seed.

59
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.600
That present is for Poly Parrot.

60
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.600
But this was the last one.

61
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.100
Santa has forgotten me.

62
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.700
Hello?

63
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.000
Can I talk to Peppa please?

64
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.900
Peppa, it's Susie Sheep.

65
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.200
Hello, Susie.

66
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.100
Did you get your doll?

67
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.200
No. 

68
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.500
I got mine. 

69
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.800
It cries and laughs and closes its eyes and everything.

70
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.200
Santa has given you my doll!

71
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.200
No. The label says, "For Susie Sheep."

72
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.800
And Santa has forgotten me.

73
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.700
Ho-ho-ho.

74
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.000
Santa is on his way home.

75
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.500
That's the last stop this year's toys delivered.

76
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.100
Oh! What's this at the bottom of my sack? 

77
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.200
Santa can't have forgotten you.

78
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.100
I have been a good piggy, haven't I?

79
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.600
Ho-ho-ho!

80
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.700
Santa!

81
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700
Ah…hello!?

82
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700
He came down our chimney!

83
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.700
Of course he did granny!

84
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.000
Here's your present Peppa. 

85
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.400
Sorry it's a bit late.

86
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.100
My doll! Thank you, Santa.

87
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100
Would you like some Christmas pudding?

88
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.900
George and I stirred it and made wishes.

89
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.000
Mmm…Yummy!

90
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.100
And I wish that Santa would visit us on 

91
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.500
Christmas day and you did.

92
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.500
Ho-ho-ho!
