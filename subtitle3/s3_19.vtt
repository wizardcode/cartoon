00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
Peppa and George are having a
sleepover at Granny and Grandpa’s house.

2
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.000
Granny pig!

3
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.900
Hello~ my little ones!

4
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.700
Bye bye ,see you later.

5
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.800
Bye bye mommy.

6
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.600
Come and see where you
are going to sleep tonight.

7
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.100
This was mommy pig’s room
when she was a little piggy.

8
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
In the old times!

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
And this is the bed mommy slept on.

10
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740
Oh, bouncy bed

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.900
You are just like your
mommy when she was little.

12
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
Did mommy bounce on the bed?

13
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
Of course!

14
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.100
But mommy tells us
not to bounce on the beds.

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.600
When mommy was a little piggy,

16
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
she was cheeky just like you.

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.900
Was she?

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
Yes! Now let’s go and
 see grandpa pig in the garden.

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600
Grandpa pig!

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Hello Peppa, Hello George,
Come and see my carrots.

21
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Grandpa pig is very proud of his vegetables.

22
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.400
Wow

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.000
And here are my peas.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Ohhh

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.773
But best of 
all are my lettuces .Oh, No!My lettuces!

26
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.500
I think the birds
have eaten them, grandpa

27
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Yes, birds!

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Why did you miss the
scarecrows scare them away?

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Because the birds that
ate my lettuces are very stupid!

30
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.300
What’s the matter, grandpa pig?

31
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.200
Your friends have been
eating my vegetables again!

32
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.100

33
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.200

34
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100

35
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.000

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.900
