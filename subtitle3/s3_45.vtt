00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Peppa and her friends
 are going to the gym today.

2
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.300
Let's check
 you've all got your gym kits on.

3
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.400
Pedro is wearing a super hero costume.

4
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.800
Pedro, where is your gym kits?

5
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.600
It's at home.
 I thought it was dressing-Up day!

6
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
Follow me, children.

7
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.400
This is the gym
 where Mommies and daddies

8
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Come to exercise and enjoy themselves.

9
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.000
Are you all having fun?

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yes, lots of fun.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.600
Your gym teacher
 for today is Grampy rabbit?

12
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.800
Where is he?

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.000
Hello, children. 
Are you ready to exercise?

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.784
Yes, Grampy rabbit.

15
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.800
Do we have to do that?

16
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.200
No, that's surely for big athletes like me.

17
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
Not for little explorers like you.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.600
We are not explorers.

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
I'll make explorers of you.

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.900
But you, you look like a super hero.

21
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.700
It's just pretend.

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.500
Pretending, 
that's good. Right, let's warm up.

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Everyone run
 on the spot and flap your arms.

24
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.900
Now, stretch. 
Stretch. Wobble like a jelly.

25
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.600
And, rest. Now we're all warmed up.

26
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.900
We can start.

27
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.300
Start what?

28
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.200
Your adventure.

29
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.000
I want you to 
pretend that this room is a jungle.

30
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It doesn't look like a jungle.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.800
Where're the trees?

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.400
You have to imagine it.

33
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.400
The trees, the rain, 
the fast clean river at your feet.

34
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Your first adventure 
is to walk on this beam across the river.

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.351
That's easy!

36
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.000
But it's night time and it's windy.

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.100
What's?

38
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.300
That's how it was for me.

39
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.395
It was a dark and stormy 
night. I was on an adventure.

40
00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:35.514
 Ready?

41
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.200
But it's not windy or night time.

42
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.600
You have to pretend.

43
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.900
Everyone crosses the pretend river safely.

44
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900
Hurray!

45
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.700
Well done! My little explorers.

46
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.100
What's next? Grampy Rabbit?

47
00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.110
Your next adventure is to swim 
across this swamp full of crocodiles.

48
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.100
I can't see any crocodiles.

49
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100
You've got to pretend.

50
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.700
Let those crocodiles know who's boss.

51
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.800
Go away! You naughty crocodiles.

52
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.700
That's the spirit.

53
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700
Did you ever 
swim across a crocodile swamp?

54
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.200
Of course, I did.

55
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.000
Were you scared?

56
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Not scared as they were of me.

57
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.300
Ready? Don't forget to do the call.

58
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.000
Everyone has crossed the 
pretend crocodile swamp safely.

59
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.200
Well done!

60
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800
What's our next adventure?

61
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.800
This is a fort, big 
athlete jump over it, like this.

62
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.500
But you can pretend it's a dinosaur,
 and crawl through its legs.

63
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.600
Have you crawled through 
a dinosaur's legs Grampy Rabbit?

64
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.600
Oh, yes. Once I was walking in the jungle

65
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600
When I stumbled
 into a lost world of dinosaurs.

66
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.700
And that's it! 
You've made it out of a jungle.

67
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.300
Hurray!

68
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.700
Did you have a good gym class, children?

69
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.300
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

70
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.200
They're real little explorers now.

71
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.100
We walked across a river.

72
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.500
And we swam over crocodiles.

73
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.000
And we crawled down to a dinosaur.

74
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I love doing
 Gym Class with Grampy Rabbit.
