00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.100
Peppa and George
are playing in their bedroom.

2
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.900
This will be the best house ever!

3
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.386
George, Richard Rabbit is here.

4
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
George!

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.400
Richard!

6
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.300
Dinosaur！

7
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.600
Bye bye, Richard.

8
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll be back to pick you up later!

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
George and Richard are best friends.

10
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.500
George！Richard！

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
You've knocked my house down.

12
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.500
Please play something not bouncy.

13
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.400
Ha ha ha!

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.361
George has made
 the toy basket into a volcano.

15
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.800
Richard is using toy trees to make a jungle.

16
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600
George has used 
building blocks to make a river.

17
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300
Dinosaur! Dinosaur!

18
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.000
George and Richard have
 turned the bedroom into dinosaur land.

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.580
I leave it. It's too noisy.

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.700
I say potato. And I say potato. 
Potato! Potato! Potato! Potato!

21
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.400
The good thing about rainy days is

22
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.876
we get to watch important TV programs.

23
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.700
Potato! Potato! Potato!

24
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.748
Mommy, George and Richard 
have made the bedroom into dinosaur land.

25
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.087
And dinosaur land is very noisy.

26
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.700
George has his best friend here,

27
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.700
but I've got no one to play with.

28
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.600
You could ask Susie Sheep to come over.

29
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.100
Susie Sheep is Peppa's best friend.

30
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.400
Can Susie really come over now?

31
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.700
Let's ring her.

32
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.808
Mie! Hello, Susie Sheep's speaking.

33
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.900
Susie, it's me. 
Can you come to my house now?

34
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900
Yes, Peppa! 
Can I wear my nurse's costume?

35
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.226
Yes, but come quickly.

36
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.608
Bye bye, Susie! 
I'll be back… to pick you up later.

37
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.200
George! Richard! Nurse Susie is here.

38
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.635
And nurse Susie 
says this is not dinosaur land.

39
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.147
It's a hospital.
 And a hospital must be clean and tidy.

40
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
The bedroom is not
 dinosaur land anymore. It is a hospital.

41
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.500
I am an important doctor. 
This dinosaur looks sick.

42
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.300
I agree, doctor.

43
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300
He's a very 
greeny-ill color. He must go to bed.

44
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.200
And this dinosaur
 looks very purply-ill color.

45
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.800
Yes, doctor. He must go to bed, too.

46
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.100
Dinosaur!

47
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.731
Sh-sh！Quiet in the hospital.

48
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.769
Choo choo!

49
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.500
The bedroom is not a hospital any more.

50
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.300
Now it's a railway station.

51
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.300
No! No! There aren't any trains in fairyland.

52
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.400
Oh, now the bedroom is fairyland.

53
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.291
Only pretty things are allowed in fairyland.

54
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.700
What's all this crying about?

55
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.300
George and Richard 
want to play dinosaurs and trains.

56
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.300
And we want to play hospitals and fairies.

57
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.900
Uh, I see the rain has stopped outside.

58
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.400
So?

59
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.200
So maybe you could all play outside.

60
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.600
But they like little boys' games.

61
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.800
And we like grown-up girls' games.

62
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.152
But after it's been raining in the garden,

63
00:04:25.152 --> 00:04:28.600
what you normally find…

64
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.500
Muddy?

65
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.000
Puddles!

66
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.700
And what are muddy puddles for?

67
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.552
Jumping up and down in!

68
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800
Everyone loves jumping up 
and down in muddly puddles

69
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.572
whether they're big girls or little boys.
