00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.600
It is a lovely sunny day.

2
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.500
Peppa is playing with her fancy ball.

3
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.500
George and his friend Edmond
Elephant are playing with their space toys.

4
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.400
Moon, moon

5
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.100
George is pretending
the bouncy ball is the moon.

6
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.700
I was playing with that ball. Ooh…

7
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.600
Edmond’s space toy
has landed on Peppa’s head.

8
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.500
This looks fun.
Are you going to the moon?

9
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.710
It is just boring space
stuff for baby study. It’s not real.

10
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.800
But space is real, Peppa,

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
And there are real
rockets that go to the moon.

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.100
And museum has a
show all about the moon.

13
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.400
Shall we go and see it?

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.700
Yeah

15
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.600
Will we really have to go to the moon?

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.800
NO, Peppa, we are not going to the moon.

17
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.300
We are going to the museum.

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.646
Ok

19
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
Here is the museum.

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.200
Hello, everyone.

21
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.100
Have you come to see the moon show?

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.824
Yes, Miss Rabbit, five tickets, please.

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.200
There you are.

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100
Enjoy your trip to the moon.

25
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Ooh, we really are going to the moon.

26
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.800
No, Peppa, it’s just pretend.

27
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.600
This way for our trip to the moon.

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.480
Mr. Rabbit is 
the tour guide. Prepare, take off.

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.000
It is just pretend, isn’t?

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.700
That’s right, Peppa. It’s just pretend.

31
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.236
Five, four, three, two, one, blast off!

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.600
We live on a planet.
Does anyone know what it is called?

33
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.800
The Earth

34
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
That’s right.

35
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.900
I am a bit of expert at the space things.

36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.600
There’re seven other
planets that go around our sun.

37
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.800
Does anyone know what they are call?

38
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.100
Mercury,

39
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.300
Oh, well done, Edmond.

40
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.300
Venus 金星, Mars火星, Jupiter木星,
Saturn土星, Neptune海王星, Uranus天王星

41
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.500
Edmond knows all about the space.

42
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.017
I am clever (clout?).

43
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.200
Does anyone know what
these planets are made of?

44
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200
They are made of cardboard.

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.151
These models are made of cardboard.

46
00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:43.000
But the real planets are
made of rock and ice and gas.

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.400
But of course the moon is made of cheese.

48
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.800
No, the moon is made of
rock and this is a serious tour.

49
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.634
So no jokes and no giggling.

50
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.900
Here we are, on the moon.

51
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.100
It’s a pretend moon, really, isn’t?

52
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.100
Yes, if this was the real moon,
you could jump over my head.

53
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.900
Does anyone know
 why we can jump so high on the moon?

54
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.500
Gravity.

55
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.100
Oh, that’s right, Edmond.

56
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.300
Gravity is what keeps us on the ground.

57
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.100
It is weaker on the moon,
so you can jump higher.

58
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.300
We can make you feel
like you are jumping on the moon

59
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.600
With a help of science.

60
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300
That sounds impressive.

61
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.700
How do you do that?

62
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.200
With big rubber bands.

63
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.470
Everyone is scrapping into
Mr.Rabbit’s anti-Gravity rubber bands.

64
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.300
Bouncing on the pretend moon is fun.

65
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300
Say moon cheese

66
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.800
Moon cheese

67
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.500
And that’s the end of the tour.

68
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.000
Please walk this way.

69
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Are there trees on the moon?

70
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.800
No

71
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.600
Are there any castles on the moon?

72
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.700
No

73
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.200
Are there any moon shops?

74
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.700
No. That would be silly.

75
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.400
Welcome to the moon shop.

76
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.300
We’ve got moon maps, moon books and

77
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.400
We’ve even got a picture of
piggies on the moon with an elephant.

78
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.700
Look there we are, jumping on the moon.

79
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.800
We’ve got moon rock, too.

80
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.800
It got a picture of the moon
all the way through the middle.

81
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.400
Wu…

82
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.000
How about some real moon cheese?

83
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.600
How much is it, Miss Rabbit?

84
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.604
Five pounds, please.

85
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.052
Five pounds?

86
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.355
It’s all for good cause.

87
00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:38.618
I like the moon now
because it’s very interesting.

88
00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:43.209
Mmm, and very tasty.
