00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.200
Peppa, George and Granny Pig are

2
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.400
going out for a day on Grandpa Pig's boat.

3
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.100
Ahoy there! Peppa and George!

4
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.000
We are ready to go sailing.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
I'll move the boat to a bit nearer.

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.200
Careful you
don't hit that big stick, grandpa!

7
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.100
That's a mooring post. I won't hit it.

8
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
Oh.

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.100
Grandpa, there's a big hole in your boat.

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.600
It's just a scratch.

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.200
Woo~ Grandpa's boat is sinking.

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.000
Quick, Grandpa Pig, jump off!

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
A captain never leaves his sinking ship.

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Grandpa Pig's boat
has sunk to the bottom of the river.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.900
It is Granddad Dog.

16
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.400
Woof! Ahoy there,
Grandpa Pig! Lovely day for a sail.

17
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100
I'm...Yes, ahoy there!

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.700
I'm taking my boat to the boatyard today,

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.900
Going to get a few repairs done.

20
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.500
Would you mind taking
my boat to the boatyard, too? Please...

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
Of course.

22
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.200
Where is your boat?

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.700
Um...I'm standing on it.

24
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Oho. Has it sunk?

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.900
Well, a little bit.

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.200
I'm surprised your
boat didn't sink a long time ago.

27
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.100
What?! It's a better
boat than that rust bucket of yours.

28
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.500
Woof! Woof! Woof!

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.400
Oink! Oink! Oink!

30
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.600
Grandpa Pig and
Granddad Dog are very best friends.

31
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.200
Catch this, captain!

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Aye, aye! Skip up!

33
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
Granddad's truck has
lifted Grandpa Pig's boat out of the water.

34
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.200
Wow.

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.800
Next stop, the boatyard.

36
00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:07.300
What's the boatyard?

37
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.300
A boatyard, Peppa,
is where broken boats get mended.

38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.000
This is Grampy Rabbit's boatyard.

39
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.600
Ahoy there. Me hearties!

40
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.100
Ahoy there, Grampy Rabbit!

41
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.800
Woo, who did
that to your boat, Grandpa Pig?

42
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
Um...Someone
drove it into a mooring post.

43
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.200
It went rush and made a big hole there.

44
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.300
You should never let
other people steer your boat, Grandpa Pig.

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.200
Um... Yes, can you mend it?

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.400
Of course,
I just need to size up the damage.

47
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.500
Grampy Rabbit is
measuring the hole in Grandpa Pig's boat.

48
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.300
Now, I need to find
something to patch it up.

49
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.400
It must be good
to know how to mend a boat.

50
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.900
Oh, it takes years
to learn how to mend a boat.

51
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.700
How long have you been mending boats?

52
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.600
Years.

53
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.050
Grampy Rabbit has collected
lots of scrap metal to mend boats bit.

54
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.238
Now this is a gold mine.

55
00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:12.604
It's a pile of rubbish!

56
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.700
But you can make
things from piles of rubbish.

57
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.800
Like what?

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.000
Like submarine!

59
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.100
Wow!

60
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.400
Grampy Rabbit has
made a submarine out of rubbish.

61
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.000
Does it actually work?

62
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.164
Watch this! It fills up
with water so it's very good at going down.

63
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
But not so good at coming back up.

64
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600
Now this is what I've been looking for.

65
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.900
It's a washing machine.

66
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.900
It's the fix for
Grandpa Pig's boat is what it is.

67
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.200
You are going to mend my
boat with a bit of washing machine?

68
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.600
Yes!

69
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.900
That's as good as new!

70
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.500
Hooray!

71
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.310
Now we test it.

72
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.701
Prepare for launch!Aye, aye!

73
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.300
Amazing! It floats!

74
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.200
You sound surprised.

75
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200
Yes, usually they sink on the first go.

76
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.600
Now we can go for our day on the river.

77
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.900
What a splendid idea.

78
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.521
This is the life out on a
boat with just the sea and the sky!

79
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.300
I know a song about the sea and the sky.

80
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.700
Do you want to hear it?

81
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.700
No, thank you.

82
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.200
Yes, please.

83
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.500
I got up this morning.

84
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.000
The sea was still there, so was the sky.

85
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.900
Hahahahaha.

86
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.500
I got up this morning.

87
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.300
The sea was still there,

88
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.400
So was the sky. The sea, the sky....
