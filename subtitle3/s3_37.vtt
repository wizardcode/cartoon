Hello, Peppa.

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.500
Why have you got that mask on your face?

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.500
So people don't know
it's me. I'm in a secret club.

6
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.500
Wow. Can I be in your secret club?

7
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Sh------It's not easy to get into.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200
You have to say the secret word.

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
what word?

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.900
Blaba double!    Blaba double!

11
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.000
Right, you're in.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.100
Danny Dog has come to play.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.500
Hello, Peppa. Hello, Suzy.

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.700
Sh------

15
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.800
What?

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm in a secret club.

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.500
Im in it too.    Woo------

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.900
Pedro Pony, Candy Cat and
Rebecca Rabbit have come to play.

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.700
Hello.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.300
Sh-------

21
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Suzy and Peppa have been in a secret club.

22
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.200
Can we join your secret club?

23
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.900
It's very hard to get into.

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.900
You have to say the
secret word. Shalana cookie.

25
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.300
Shalana cookie.

26
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.500
That's not the word I said.

27
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.000
It changes all the time. To keep it secret.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.900
Oh.

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.100
Are we in the secret club now?

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.600
You're in.

31
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.000
What do we do?

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.400
We do secret things in secret.

33
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.200
And secretly go on secret missions.

34
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.700
I don't know what you're talking about.

35
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.300
Show us how you do the secret mission.

36
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.200
Yes! Show us!

37
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.300
Er------- Peppa can do it.

38
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.900
You've got the mask on, Suzy.

39
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.900
Okay. My secret mission
is to get biscuits. Watch this.

40
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Suzy Sheep is trying not to be seen.

41
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.400
Mummy, can I have some
biscuits for my friends, please?

42
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.300
Of course. Here you are.

43
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.000
Thank you, Mummy.

44
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.100
Suzy Sheep has returned with the biscuits.

45
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.300
Hooray.

46
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
Sh-----

47
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.900
Hooray.

48
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.400
Did anyone see you?

49
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.500
No. Well, only a grown-up.

50
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
Look out.

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
Would you like some
juice to go with your biscuits?

52
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.500
What biscuits?

53
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
The biscuits that I
just gave you for your friends.

54
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.700
Oh. Suzy!

55
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.600
What's the matter?

56
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.700
We're in a secret club, doing secret things.

57
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.700
And Suzy's told every one.

58
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.700
Oh. Can I be in your secret club, please?

59
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.200
Please, I've always
wanted to be in a secret club.

60
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.900
It's very hard to get into.

61
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.000
You must say the secret word?

62
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.100
Which is?

63
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100
Pick niddle noodle.

64
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.900
Pick niddle noodle.

65
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.700
That's it. You're in.

66
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.300
What happens now?

67
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.000
Look out.

68
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.900
It's Daddy Pig.

69
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.600
You talk to my Daddy

70
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.300
But don't say
anything about our secret club.

71
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.000
Hello, ah-----there you're,
Mummy Sheep. What's new?

72
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.200
Er------er------er------secret club.

73
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.800
Oh, no!

74
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.700
Oh.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.300
I always wanted to be
in a secret club. Can I join, please?

76
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.200
You can't join, Daddy.

77
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.600
Because you're a grown-up.

78
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.100
Er------my Mummy is a grown-up.

79
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.300
Well, you have to know the magic word.

80
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.600
Which is?

81
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.700
Pappa diddo dodo dum.

82
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.500
Pappa diddo dodo dum.

83
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.800
You're in.

84
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.200
What do I do now?

85
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.700
Look out.

86
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.200
It's Mummy Pig.

87
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.200
Follow Mummy in secret.

88
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.300
Daddy pig?

89
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Ah------hello, Mummy Pig.

90
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.400
What're you doing in that bush?

91
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.300
Er------er------secret club.

92
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.849
Oh.

93
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.690
I'd always wanted to be in a secret club.

94
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.800
We can't have everyone in the secret club.

95
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800
It wouldn't be a secret.

96
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.900
Oh.

97
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.800
I suppose it doesn't
have to be a secret secret club.

98
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
It can be everybody's secret club.

99
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.300
And everybody can be in it.

100
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.300
Oh, goodie.
