00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800
It is a lovely sunny day.

2
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.300
Peppa and her family
 are driving to the playground.

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
Is everybody ready?

4
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
Yes, daddy pig.

5
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.300
Then let's go!

6
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.300
We are going to the playground.

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.800
Vroom…...Vroom……

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.200
George and peppa 
love going to the playground.

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.900
Oh, why have we stopped?

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.800
It's a traffic jam.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.800
But we need to get to the playground.

12
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.500
Don't worry, George.
 The traffic is moving again.

13
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Stop!

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.100
Mr. Bull has stopped the traffic.

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.600
What's the problem, Mr. Bull?

16
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.900
Moo…..We are digging up the road.

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.100
There's water coming out of the ground!

18
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.600
Yes. That's what we are here to fix.

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.100
Is it going to take long?

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.100
It will take as long as it takes.

21
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700
Digger. Digger.

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.100
George likes diggers.

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.400
This Way, Mr. Rhino

24
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.900
Ok, boss.

25
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.800
Mr. Bull is the boss.

26
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.400
Mr. Bull, 
where's all that water coming from?

27
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.400
It's coming from a 
broken water pipe underground.

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.100
How are you going to fix it?

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.100
We dig up the road!

30
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.500
Wow!

31
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.500
We turn the water off.

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.300
George loves cranes.

33
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.900
Crane. Crane.

34
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.594
We take the old pipe out 

35
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.180
and put the new one in.

36
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.700
Thank you for 
showing us your work, Mr. Bull.

37
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.700
Moo….No problem. Bye, See you later!

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.700
Oh, dear. Geroge
 doesn't want to leave Mr. Bull.

39
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.100
We are going to the playground, Geroge.

40
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.100
You can play diggers 
and cranes in the sand pit.

41
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.454
And you will see
 Mr. Bull again on our way home.

42
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.965
Peppa and her family
 have arrived at the playground.

43
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.200
Hello, everyone.

44
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.400
Hello, Peppa!

45
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.400
Edmond elephant and Richard
 Rabbit are playing in the sand pit.

46
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.700
Let's play in the sand pit.

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.000
Ok.

48
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.900
Stop.

49
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.800
What's the problem?

50
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.100
We are digging up 
the road and I am the boss.

51
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.073
Oh…

52
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.500
Is it going to take long?

53
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.100
It'll take as long as it'll take.

54
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.318
We have to make a hole.

55
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.032
We fill it in 

56
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.501
and the road is mended.

57
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.535
Hooray!

58
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.300
Peppa, George. It's time to go home.

59
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.700
Ah

60
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
Oh, dear.
 George doesn't want to go home yet.

61
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.900
On the way home, George,

62
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.100
we can see Mr. Bull digging up the road.

63
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.300
Bye, everyone.

64
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.378
Bye, peppa.

65
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.300
Peppa and George are looking 
forward to seeing Mr. Bull again.

66
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.400
Digger. Crane. Vroom…..

67
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.900
Here we are.

68
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.500
Oh, Mr. Bull is not here.

69
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.500
Mr. Bull must
 have finished and gone home.

70
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.600
Digger. Crane. Vroom.

71
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.400
Moo….Stop!

72
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.000
Oh, is the water pipe broken again?

73
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.936
No, peppa.
 This time it's faulty electrical cables.

74
00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:30.366
How to mend electrical cables?

75
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.900
We dig up the road!

76
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.900
Hooray!

77
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.933
Peppa and George love it 
when Mr.Bull digs up the road.

78
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.200
Everyone loves it 
when Mr. Bull digs up the road.
