00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Peppa and her family 
are watching sport on television.

2
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.900
It's a long jump.

3
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.000
It's a new world record!

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.100
Mummy, what's a world record?

5
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.800
It means you are
 best in the world at something.

6
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.900
Then you are a champion,
 and your name goes in a book.

7
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.700
There are champions
 for running, jumping, swimming…

8
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.400
I wish you were in the book, daddy.

9
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.200
I am in the book.

10
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.100
No!

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Yes, Daddy Pig is champion puddle jumper.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.300
wow…

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
No one's beaten me yet.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.400
I don't think they ever will.

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.400
The next event is the puddle jump.

16
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
That was a very big splash.
 In fact, I think yes!

17
00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:15.200
it's a new world record!

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.300
Oh…

19
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.400
Daddy, you
 are not the champion any more.

20
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.100
Everyone will be sad.

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.700
HOHo, I'm sure

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.748
they've got more 
important things to worry about, Peppa.

23
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.100
Daddy pig, you lost the world record

24
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.500
Everyone wants you to be champion again.

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200
It's important.

26
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.100
Really?

27
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.300
Yes.

28
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.400
Ok. I'll do it tomorrow.

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.600
Hurray!

30
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.800
But I'll have to train myself to

31
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.300
jump in muddy puddles again.

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.000
Everyone knows how
 to jump in muddy puddles, daddy.

33
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.900
Aha, but not
 everyone is a champion, Peppa.

34
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.100
Daddy pig is the master.

35
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.900
Daddy, are you going to
 practice jumping up and down?

36
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.200
No, Peppa.
 I must be at one with the puddle.

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.600
What?

38
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.800
To jump in a puddle,

39
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.600
I must think like a puddle.

40
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.700
Do you need to do running?

41
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 No.

42
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.800
Do you need to do press-ups?

43
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.800
No. I need to sleep
 and dream about puddles.

44
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
It is the day of the big puddle jump.

45
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.700
Daddy Pig is wearing
 his puddle jumping costume.

46
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300
I can't find my golden boots.

47
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.600
I gave those old boots 
to grandpa for his gardening.

48
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.200
My lucky golden boots 
to be used as gardening boots!

49
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.700
You've got other ones.

50
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.200
It's not the same.

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.100
Hello？

52
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.700
Grandpa,
 remember those old boots I gave you?

53
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.200
Uh…yes?

54
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.400
Daddy needs them back urgently.

55
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600
You have been looking after them?

56
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.600
Um…they have been watered.

57
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Grandpa Pig is growing 
tomatoes in daddy's lucky boots.

58
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.200
We need them for the puddle jump today.

59
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.600
Right, I'll meet you there.

60
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Everyone has come to
 watch daddy pig's puddle jump.

61
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.900
Please welcome 
your friend and mine Mr. Potato.

62
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.600
Hurray!

63
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.900
Good luck, Daddy Pig. Oh,

64
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.100
but where are your lucky boots?

65
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.600
Uh, here they are.

66
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.000
Thank you, Grandpa Pig.

67
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.700
I can smell tomatoes.

68
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.300
And now for Daddy Pig's puddle jump.

69
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.700
Daddy pig is thinking.

70
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.300
Ready, steady, go!

71
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.200
I must become one with the puddle.

72
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.200
I must be the puddle. Wow…

73
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.900
The puddle has gone!

74
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.000
The puddle has gone over all of us.

75
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.500
Daddy pig has become one with the puddle.

76
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
Everyone has become one with the puddle.

77
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.800
It's a new world record!

78
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.400
Hurray~

79
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.400
Champion daddy pig!

80
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.100
And who is this?

81
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.700
I'm Peppa Pig. One day,

82
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.200
I will be the champion puddle jumper.

83
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.600
I've been training her.

84
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.800
Uh…to be trained by the master.

85
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
What have you learned?

86
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.200
Uh…if you jump in muddy puddles,

87
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.200
you must wear your boots.
