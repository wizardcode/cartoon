1
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
It is bed time for Peppa and George.

2
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.800
Tomorrow we're going
on a coach trip to the seaside.

3
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.900
We can make sand castles!

4
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.400
I fancy a swim.

5
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Me, too! The weather
forecast says it's going to be sunny.

6
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.956
Good night, Peppa! Good night, George!

7
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.258
Oh! It is starting to snow.

8
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.800
It is morning.

9
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.800
Yipee! It's sunny! Oh! Snow!

10
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.200
A lot of snow has fallen in the night.

11
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.700
Snow, mummy!
Snow, daddy! Snow, snow, snow!

12
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.600
Hey, What?

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.694
We're still going to the seaside, don't we?

14
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.093
Well, let's see how much snow there is.

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.700
Oh, where's daddy gone?

16
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh, it's a walking snowman.

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.100
I'm cold.

18
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000
It's a walking talking snowman.

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.100
Oh, it's just daddy.

20
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.700
Poor daddy! Let's warm you up a bit!

21
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.400
Haha ha.

22
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.300
mummy Pig,

23
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.087
Peppa and George are warming
Daddy Pig up by rubbing him with towels.

24
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.900
That's better.

25
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.400
Now we can go to the seaside.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.000
But what about the snow?

27
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.327
I don't think the
coach should be running today

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.400
Oh.

29
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.900
Miss Rabbit's coach
has arrived at Peppa's house.

30
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.300
Goodness me!

31
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.700
How did you get through all that snow?

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.000
With my big snow plough!

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.700
Snow plough's
pushed the snow after the way.

34
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.100
Hello, everyone!

35
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.700
Hello, Peppa!

36
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.000
All of Peppa's friends
are going to the seaside, too.

37
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.500
Next stop, the seaside!

38
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.700
Hooray!

39
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.200
Mr Bull and his
friends are grating the road.

40
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.400
The grate melts the snow.

41
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800
Hello, Mr Bull!

42
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800
Oh! Hello, Miss Rabbit!

43
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.900
It's taken us all night.

44
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.100
But the road is clear
all the way to the seaside.

45
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100
That's good. We're going to the seaside.

46
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.700
Would you like to come along?

47
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.667
No, thanks, Mrs Rabbit.

48
00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:35.414
We've got more roads to grate.
Goodbye, Mr Bull.

49
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800
Bye, have a lovely day at the beach.

50
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.200
We were going on a seaside holiday.

51
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.900
Sand castles, swimming and sunny skies.

52
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.000
We were going on a seaside holiday.

53
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Sea and sun and ice-cream, too!

54
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.200
Here we are! The seaside!

55
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.900
The beach is covered in snow.

56
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.900
Oh!

57
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.657
That sea looks cold.

58
00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:05.700
I was looking forward to having a swim.

59
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.200
You still can! The sea's not frozen over.

60
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.800
Come along, girls!

61
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.400
What are you waiting for?

62
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.300
Oh, I can't swim because I sprain my ankle.

63
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.400
And I think I might have a cough.

64
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.100
Come on in, Mummy Pig. It's lovely.

65
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.200
Are you sure it's lovely?

66
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.000
Of course, the sea is wonderful today.

67
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.800
OK, then.

68
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.400
mummy Pig is going for a swim.

69
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh ho.

70
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400
Is it cold, mummy?

71
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.100
It's a little bit cold.

72
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.000
It always feels cold when you first get in.

73
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.700
If you keep moving, you'll warm up.

74
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.019
OK, I'll keep moving.

75
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.997
Mummy Pig has run out of the sea.

76
00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:49.355
Let's get you dry.

77
00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.600
Peppa, George and Daddy Pig

78
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.900
are warming mummy Pig
up by rubbing her with towels.

79
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.400
Oh, that's better.

80
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.100
Are you going for a swim, Daddy Pig?

81
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.200
Maybe not today.

82
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.000
Who wants an ice-cream?

83
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.700
Me, me, me!

84
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.200
Everyone likes ice creams of the seaside.

85
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.400
I wanted to make sand castles.

86
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.000
But the beach is covered in snow.

87
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.100
We could make snow castles.

88
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.000
Woo.

89
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.600
First, we fill the buckets with snow.

90
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.900
We turn the buckets upside down.

91
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.800
Give them a little tap.

92
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.400
And hey, presto, a snow castle!

93
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.700
Snow castles!

94
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.000
I love the seaside!

95
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.200
And I love the snow!

96
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.800
I love the seaside and the snow!

97
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.700
Haha haha.

98
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.400
We were going on a seaside holiday.

99
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.200
Sand castles, swimming and sunny skies.

100
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.000
We were going on a seaside holiday.

101
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Sea and sun and ice-cream, too!
