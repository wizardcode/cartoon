It's a lovely sunny day,

2
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.837
and Suzie sheep
has come to play with Peppa.

3
00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:25.203
Hello, Suzie! Hello, Peppa!

4
00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:27.834
Peppa and Suzie are best friends.

5
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.600
Guess what happened to me yesterday?

6
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.800
Yesterday I went to
the duck pond and I saw Mrs. duck.

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
Well, yesterday…

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
Then I went to
the supermarket with mommy.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.900
we bought bread, carrots and ... What's wrong?

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.300
You talk too much, blah, blah, blah,

11
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.100
just like that. blah, blah, blah.

12
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Mommy, Susie said I talked too much.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.100
Well, you are a bit of chatterbox, Peppa

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.800
Chatter box, that's right. chatterbox here,

15
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.200
chatter box there, chatter, chatter, chatter,

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.900
you never stop talking.

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.200
I can easily stop talking if I want to.

18
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.700
No, you can't . Yes, I can.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.900
You can't!

20
00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.757
That's it. I am never going to talk again!

21
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
Hello, Suzie. Hello Peppa!

22
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.400
Hello, Zoe, you look nice today.

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.400
Thank you, Suzie, this is my new dress.

24
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100
Why are you not talking, Peppa?

25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.600
Yes, why are you not talking Peppa?

26
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
This is a silly game.

27
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.900
What's game are you playing?

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.800
Susan said I was a chatter
box and I could be never quiet.

29
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.700
You are not being very quiet now, are you?

30
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.851
Right, I am not going
to talk ever again, starting now!

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.100
Hello, everyone!
Hello, Danny! Hello, Danny!

32
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100
What's the matter with Peppa?

33
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100
She is not talking.

34
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.100
Oh, who wants the grape?
Me, please. Me, please.

35
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.500
You can't nod your head,

36
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
that's cheating,  and you can't blink.

37
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.300
Hello, everyone!

38
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.200
Hello, Pedro!

39
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.600
What's the matter with Peppa?

40
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.200
She is never going to talk ever again.Why?

41
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.600
Because she talks too much.

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
I do not talk too much, anyway,

43
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.200
you are always walking like this.

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.000
Oh look at me.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.300
And you say this micky macky boo baa boo.

47
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.000
That's nothing like me.

48
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.900
It's a bit like you,Suzie.

49
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900
You are just as noisy as me.

50
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.999
I can be quiet.
It's not easy. It's not that tough, Peppa.

51
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.200
Ok, you do it then

52
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200

53
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.116
We can show my mommy.

54
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500

56
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.500
So quiet you can drop
something over floor and hear it.

57
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.000
Quiet as a mouse.

58
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.600
You are not being quiet at all.

59
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.900
You are all being very noisy.

60
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.100
We can be quiet whenever we want.

61
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.800

Hello,I am home.
Oh I thought the house was empty.

66
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.100
Peppa and her
friends are playing being quiet.

67
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.200
It's not playing. It's very hard work.

68
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.100
Oh Peppa!

69
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.000
Peppa cannot stop herself from talking.

70
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.600
Oh daddy,
I think I might be a chatterbox.

71
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.400
That's not such a bad thing,Peppa.

72
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.800
It's good to talk. In fact,

73
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.300
I think you are an expert at talking.

74
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.300
That's right.I am an expert at talking.

75
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.600
I am an expert at talking,too.

76
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.900
No one not. I am a chatter box!

77
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.400
I am more of a chatter box than you.

78
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.400
Ho, ho, you two are just the same.

79
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.700
Yes,we are.

80
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.500
That's why we are best friends.

81
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.800
Chatter, chatter, chatter …

82
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.200
