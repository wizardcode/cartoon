It is a school day
for Peppa and her friends.

2
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Hello, children. Today,
you will be learning all about numbers.

3
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.100
Does anybody know what numbers are for?

4
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.400
Are numbers for counting?

5
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.988
Yes, Peppa! Who would
like to do some counting now?

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.500
Me! Me! Me! Me!

7
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.100
Ok. Pedro.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.500
Pedro has counted to four.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Well done, Pedro! Can
anyone count higher than four?

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.300
Me, Me, Me!

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400

Rebecca has counted to seven.

15
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.400
Excellent! Rebecca!

16
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800
Madame Gazelle?

17
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.000
Yes, Candy.

18
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.200
My mum can count to ten.Wow!

It is play time.

23
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.900
Rebecca rabbit, Zoe Zebra ,
Suzy sheep and Peppa all like to skip.

24
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.123
I like sand I like sea.
I like Suzy to skip with me.

25
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.276
I like ping. I like pang.
I like Zoe to skip along.

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.800
I know. Let’s see who can
skip the most without stopping.

27
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.900
Squeak. I’ll count.

28
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.900

00:02:10.924 --> 00:02:13.257
Hurray.   Hurray.

31
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.500
Pedro, do you want to do some skipping?

32
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.500
No thanks, Peppa. I’m hula-hooping.

33
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.900
Wibble wobble,
wibble wobble, wiggle waggle wee!

34
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900
Hula-hoop, hula-hoop, one, two, three!

35
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400
How many can you do without stopping?

36
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.500
A million and three!

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.200
Wow! That’s a lot.

38
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.100

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.500
I’m a bit tired. I’ll do the rest later.

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.600
Can you do hula-hoops, Emily?

43
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.700
I can do in my own special way!

44
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.600
Emily Elephant is
hula-hooping with her trunk! Great!

45
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600
I think that was about one hundred.

Very good.

53
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.700
But we need to be playing to do it.
