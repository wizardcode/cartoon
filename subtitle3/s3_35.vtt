00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Peppa and George's 
cousins are coming to visit today.

2
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.700
Mummy, how long
 before Cousin Chloé is here?

3
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.500
Not long now Peppa, 
Baby Alexander is coming too, remember?

4
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.025
Oh! Baby is cry ??
 all the time. They are so noisy.

5
00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:39.812
I'm sure Baby
 Alexander won't be that noisy.

6
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.900
What's that sound?

7
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.700
Is it a car alarm?

8
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.500
Is it a fire-engine?

9
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.582
No, it's Baby Alexander.

10
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
Hello Peppa! Hello George!

11
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.200
Hello Cousin Chloé!

12
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.800
Hello everyone!

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.400
Hello Uncle Pig!

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Hello!

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.900
Hello Auntie Pig!

16
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.200
You remember 
Baby Alexander, don't you Peppa?

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.000
Yes!

18
00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.400
Are you staying for a few days?

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.800
No, this is what 
Alexander needs, for just one day.

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.100
We can't go anywhere 
without all these baby things.

21
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.500
Oh.

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.400
Hello Baby Alexander.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.100
He can't talk, Peppa.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.100
If he can't talk then 
how do you know what he wants?

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.327
We guess.

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.700
I'm guessing he is hungry.

27
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.900
Peppa, would you
 like to help feed Alexander?

28
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.200
Yes, please.

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.700
It is lunch time for Baby Alexander.

30
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Cousin Peppa is going 
to feed you today, Alexander.

31
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.766
Here you are baby.

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.207
Oh, here it is.

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.922
Oh, he keeps turning his head.

34
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.389
Feeding Baby Alexander is quite hard.

35
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.600
Watch this.
 Here comes the aeroplane. Woo!

36
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Alexander likes it if you
 return the spoon as an aeroplane.

37
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.284
You have a go, Peppa.

38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.755
Here comes the aero plane. Errrrrrrrrr.

39
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.100
Open your mouth
 and in free the doors. Shh.

40
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.200
Hurray!

41
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.200
That was an aeroplane.
 Can you say "aeroplane"?

42
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100
I told you he can't talk!

43
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.500
He hasn't even said his first word yet.

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.700
Peppa, do you
 remember what your first word was?

45
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.539
No.

46
00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.549
It was "Mummy".

47
00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.900
I thought Peppa's first word was "Daddy".

48
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.700
No, "Mummy".

49
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600
What was George's first word?

50
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.200
Dino-saur.

51
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.700
George's first word was "dinosaur".

52
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Somebody looks 
like that he had a good lunch.

53
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.500
Yes, bath time I think.

54
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.100
Baby Alexander is having a bath.

55
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.000
This is Mr. Dinosaur. 
Can you say "dinosaur"?

56
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.500
Go-go!

57
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.900
He can't talk, Peppa.

58
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.600
But he will talk one day.

59
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.300
Then you'll know what he wants.

60
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.200
What do you want to do now Alexander?

61
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200
Go-go.

62
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.400
I think he wants to go for a walk.

63
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.812
He can't walk yet 
but he can go out in his buggy.

64
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000
That's a clever little buggy.

65
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Yes, Five gears,
 mud guards, at ADS standard.

66
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.800
Blah, blah, blah. That's how Daddies talk.

67
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.500
Alexander likes it when you talk, Peppa.

68
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.141
That's because I am very interesting.

69
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.900
This is the sky. Can you say "sky"?

70
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.600
Go-go.

71
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.600
The sky is where rain
 comes from. Can you say "rain"?

72
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.100
Rain is good for ducks
 and plants and making muddy puddles!

73
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.900
Peppa has found a big muddy puddle.

74
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.900
Look Alexander! 
I'm jumping up and down in a puddle.

75
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.900
I love jumping up and down in puddles.

76
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.200
Puddles.

77
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.100
Woo!

78
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.100
Alexander has said his first word! Puddles!

79
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.400
Hurray! Puddles!

80
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.000
And I taught him to say it!

81
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Puddles.
