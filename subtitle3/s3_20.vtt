00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200
It’s the end of another
day at Peppa’s play group.

2
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.693
Children, tomorrow is Talent Day.

3
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.900
What is a talent?

4
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.200
A talent is something you
like doing and you are good at.

5
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.500
I like to watch
television and I am good at it.

6
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.600
Think of something we
might like to see you do.

7
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.246
My talent is playing the guitar.

8
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.100
The parents have
arrived to pick up the children.

9
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.973
Don’t forget to think of
something to do for Talent Day tomorrow.

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.600
It is bedtime for Peppa and George.

11
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.600
I can’t go to bed yet.
I haven’t got a talent to show tomorrow.

12
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400
But you have lots of talents, Peppa.

13
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.747
Yes, I can skip. 

14
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.883
I can sing.

15
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Twinkle, twinkle, little star. I can dance.

16
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.882
It’s hard to choose one talent.
I am good at lots of things.

17
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.600
Don’t worry, you can decide tomorrow.

18
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.250
Ok.

19
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.800
It is Talent Day.

20
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.000
My talents are
skipping, singing and dancing.

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900
I practiced them all last night.

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.000
I was practicing
watching television last night.

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.200
That’s not a talent.
Madame Gazelle said so.

24
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.400
What can I do then?

25
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.300
Who would like to
show us their talent first?

26
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.400
Danny Dog

27
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.200
I can bang a drum.

28
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
I can bang it louder.

29
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.931
No, that was lovely, Danny.

30
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600
Pedro Pony, what’s your talent?

31
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.000
Magic Tricks.

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.600
Here’s a glass of water.

33
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200
It is wet and see-through.

34
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.700
Now I will make the water disappear.

35
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.700
Please close your eyes.

36
00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:36.710
Open your eyes.

37
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400
The water has gone.

38
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.500
Thank you.

39
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.824
Emily Elephant,
I am going to play the recorder.

40
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.200
And what is your talent, Rebecca?

41
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.500
I can make a special noise.

42
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
It only works if I gulp on my tiptoes.

43
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.400
That was the hiccup…

44
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.100
Yes, but what can I do?

45
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.500
Candy, what is your talent?

46
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.077
Skipping.

47
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.900
I was going to do skipping.

48
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.500
But I can still do dancing and singing.

49
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.852
My talent is singing.

50
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.800
I can still do dancing.

51
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.300
Suzie Sheep, what is your talent?

52
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.400
Dancing

53
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.500
No. you can’t dance….

54
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500
Oh, dear, dancing was Peppa’s last talent.

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.052
It is so nice that everyone has
chosen a different talent to perform

56
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now, what do we have left, Peppa.

57
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.900
I was going to skip, or sing, or dance!

58
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.800
But they have all been done.

59
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.400
A talent can be anything, Peppa.

60
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.300
But not watching television.

61
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.900
Think of something you really like to do.

62
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.700
I know! I’ve got a
talent that’s I’m really good at.

63
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.500
I wonder what Peppa’s talent could be.

64
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.500
My special talent that’s
the best dance in the whole world,

65
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.195
is jumping up and down in muddy puddle!

66
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.200
Peppa loves jumping up
and down in muddy puddles.

67
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.688
Everyone loves jumping
up and down in muddy puddles.
