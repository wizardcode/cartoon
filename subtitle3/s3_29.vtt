00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.700
It is a school day.

2
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.300
Children, Doctor Hamster
has come to talk to us today.

3
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.800
Hello everyone！

4
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.100
Hello Doctor Hamster！

5
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Doctor Hamster is a vet.

6
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.200
Who knows what a vet does?

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
…That helps sick pets get better.

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.300
That's right.

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.100
And I brought some
of my pets to show you.Woo.

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400
This is Binky, the buchy.

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.600
Hello Binky.Woo.

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.900
Can I stroke Binky?

13
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.000
Yes, very gently.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400
He feels fluffy.

15
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.600
So there is feathers.

16
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.600
They help him to fly.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.000
Flying is helping Binky get his exercise.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Can you tell me what else
Binky needs to stay fit and healthy?

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800
He needs to eat.Yes.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
He needs to drink.That's right.

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.100
He needs to breathe a bit.Very good.

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.800
He needs to sleep.Excellent.

23
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.800
Wo. Sorry, Madame Gazelle, I overslept.

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.900
Oh, Pedro, you do like sleeping.

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

26
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000
I have got a pet here who loves sleeping.

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.200
It's a tortoise.

28
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.500
It's Tiddles, the tortoise.

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200
Hello Tiddles!

30
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Tiddles has slept
all through the winter.Woo.

31
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.700
Why has he got
that shell thing on his back?

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.100
That shell is his house.

33
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.100
It's very high if he gets hurt.
Would you like to stroke him?

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.100
Yes, please. Don't be scared Tiddles.

35
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
How old is he?

36
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
Tiddles is 33.

37
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.500
That's as old as my mom.

38
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.900
But tortoises can live for a hundred years.

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.600
That's as old as my grandpa.

40
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.500
Why is he so slow?

41
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.800
He has to carry his house on his back.

42
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.263
Ah, Doctor Hamster,
I think Tiddles is escaping.

43
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.200
He can't go far.

44
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.600
Because he is so slow.

45
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.100
I have got some one
else to show you here.Dinosaur!

46
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.100
Oh! George! You always say dinosaur!

47
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.600
Oh! It is a dinosaur!Woo.

48
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600
She is not a dinosaur, this is Lulu, the lizard.

49
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.100
Hello Lulu!

50
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.800
She is scaly, like a dragon.

51
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.300
Can she breathe fire?

52
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.300
No, but she has a very long tongue.Wow.

53
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.800
Does she sleep
through the winter, like Tiddles?

54
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.700
No. Oh! Where is Tiddles?Tiddles!

55
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.800
Oh, dear! Tiddles the tortoise has run away!

56
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.600
Don't worry Doctor
Hamster, we'll find where it is.

57
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.000
Is he in the music room?

58
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.400
Tiddles is not in the music room.

59
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.600
Is he in the play house?

60
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.100
Tiddles is not in the play house.

61
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.800
Is he hiding by the coats?

62
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.400
Tiddles is not hiding by the coats.

63
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.700
I can smell Tiddles. This way.

64
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.500
Freddy fox has a very good sense of smell.

65
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
There is Tiddles!

66
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.233
Tiddles is up a tree!

67
00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:53.387
Oh, I better call for help!

68
00:03:53.388 --> 00:03:56.100
This is Mrs. Rabbit's fire station

69
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.100
Ah! Fire, fire! Fire station, where is the fire?

70
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.100
MyTiddles is over a tree.

71
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.400
What? Again?

72
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.000
Emergency, emergency….

73
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.300
Tortoise's up a tree!

74
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.300
I don't know why
you like climbing tree so much?

75
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.400
You're a tortoise!

76
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.800
Stand back!

77
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.700
Tiddles, come on Tiddles.Hurray!

78
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.600
Thank you, Mr. Rabbit!

79
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.700
Just doing my job.

80
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.900
And my job is looking after pets.

81
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.600
Where are Binky and Lulu?

82
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.900
Oh, I don't know!

83
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.900
Ah hoo, here they are, safe and sound.
