00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.500
Hello, Daddy pig speaking.

2
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.400
Monsieur pig, comment allez-vous?

3
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.600
Oh. Something is wrong with the phone.

4
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.400
You see, the phone is talking nonsense.

5
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.000
That was Monsieur Donkey,
he was speaking French.

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Ha, I thought as much.

7
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.200
Mummy, what did monsieur Donkey say?

8
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.300
He asked if little
Delphine Donkey could visit us.

9
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.500
Oh goody.

10
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Delphine Donkey is Peppa’s
very special friend from France.

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.400
Delphine’s coming to
practice talking English with us.

12
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Hooray~

13
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.900
We’d better hurry.

14
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.700
Delphine’s train is arriving any minute.

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
Last stop, all change.

16
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.500
That’s Delphine’s train!

17
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.900
Delphine!

18
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.200
Bonjour!

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.900
“Bonjour” means “Hello” in French.

20
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.800
Bonjour~

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.712
Bonjour.

22
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.601
Bonjour Mr. Donkey.

23
00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.985
My goodness,
is that huge case for Delphine?

24
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.900
Yes, Delphine has brought
a few little things for her visit.

25
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.900
Things you do not have over here
cheese, bread, tomatoes, water…

26
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
Au revoir, Delphine. I’ll be back
to pick you up tomorrow night.

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.300
Where should I put Delphine’s luggage?

28
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.800
In my room, at the very top of the house.

29
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.568
Oh.

30
00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:02.393
And this luggage
is for one night stay?

31
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Oh yes, that is why
I only pack a little bag.

32
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.900
Oh.

33
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.000
Now, Delphine is here
to practice talking English,

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.900
so we must all help her.

35
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.200
Yes, mummy.

36
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200
First, I must say sorry,
I do not speak English very well.

37
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400
You don’t speak too badly.

38
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.700
You are very kind, Monsieur Pig.

39
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.000
But may I ask you a
question about talking English?

40
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.600
Of course, I am an
expert at taking. Ask away.

41
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.883
Are English split infinitives a form
of irregular verb, or past pronoun?

42
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600
Uh…

43
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.300
Actually it’s quite late,
shall we set up Delphine’s bed?

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.376
Mummy, mummy, can Delphine sleep
in my bed, with a pillow at each end?

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.800
Good idea, Peppa.

46
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Peppa and Delphine are
sleeping at each end of the same bed.

47
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:01.900
Now children, try to go to sleep.

48
00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:07.350
You’ll get a busy day tomorrow
Delphine is visiting your play group.

49
00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:08.828
aWow.Dormez bien.

50
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.903
Dormez bien is French for “sleep well”

51
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.400
I’m not sleepy at all.

52
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.700
Let’s sing a little song to make us sleepy.

53
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.000
Yes.

54
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.400
Delphine’s pretty French
song has sent everyone to sleep.

55
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.500
Delphine has come to Peppa’s play group.

56
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.100
Madame Gazelle, this is my
French friend- Delphine Donkey.

57
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.900
Bonjour.

58
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.003
Ah, bonjour Delphine.

59
00:03:53.003 --> 00:04:00.376
Delphine sang a pretty French song last
night. Can we teach her an English song?

60
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.500
How about “The Bing-bong Song”?

61
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500
Yes, sing me this “Bing-bong song”.
It would be good for my English.

62
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.719
Ok. Wu~~

63
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.800
Good, I have learnt lots of English words.
