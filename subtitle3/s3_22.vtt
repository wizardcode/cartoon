00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.400
Grandpa peppa pig is
looking after peppa and George today.

2
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.400
Now grandpa I will tell
you how everything works.

3
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.900
This is the slide.

4
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.700
You climb up here and you slide down there.

5
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.900
And everyone takes it in turns.

6
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.300
Ho ! Ho! I know what a slide is, peppa.

7
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.800
I used to play on one myself

8
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.900
when I was a little piggy.

9
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.800
Did you 
have swings, too in the olden days?

10
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.900
Ho! Ho! We had
swings and climbing frames

11
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.592
and roundabouts.
But my favorite was the slide.

12
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
It’s my favorite, too.

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Everyone takes it in
turns to have a go on the slide.

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Naughty Richard,
you know you have to wait turn.

15
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Richard rabbit finds
it’s hard to wait his turn.

16
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.300
Oh! Dear, it’s not
easy being small, is it Richard?

17
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.700
Because Richard is little,

18
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.500
I don’t think you should have to wait.

19
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.100
I wouldn’t change the
rules if I were you grandpa pig.

20
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.700
Nonsense, 
the children understand, don’t you?

21
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.300
ha ha!

22
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.300
But Grandpa, George is
little and he has to wait his turn.

23
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.900
Yes, George is little, so
he shouldn’t have to wait neither.

24
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.000
oh! Dear,

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.200
Richard and George are
taking all the turns on this slide.

26
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.700
grandpa, when do we get go on the slide.

27
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.700
Don’t worry, peppa,
they won’t be on it for long .

28
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.900
I am bored of waiting.

29
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.527
Me too! Let’s play on the swing.

30
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.800
Here is Pedro Pony on the swing.

31
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
Pedro, can I have a go now?

32
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.100
I just want to swing a bit more.

33
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.500
But you have on the swing for ages.

34
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.800
Grandpa pig , could
you push me a little bit please?

35
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.500
I think it is 
someone else’s turn now, Pedro.

36
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.700
But I have to go home soon.

37
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.600
Oh, I see!
 That’s different. Let me push you then.

38
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.447
But, grandpa.

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.400
I’m bored of waiting.

40
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400
Me too!

41
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.500
And me!

42
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.700
Let’s play on the roundabout.

43
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.300
Everyone wants to get on the roundabout.

44
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.300
Too many children on
the roundabout. Everybody off!

45
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.600
But grandpa pig, I was actually here first.

46
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.300
Ah! Then you can
get back on the roundabout.

47
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.700
I need to get on too.

48
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.200
Why is that? Rebecca.

49
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400
Because it’s my birthday soon.

50
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.600
Oh! Ok!

51
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.000
And me.

52
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.600
All right, is everybody ready?

53
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.700
Yes.

54
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.700
Stop, there are no boys on the roundabout.

55
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.000
Now is everybody ready?

56
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.900
I’m wearing glasses. Can I go on please?

57
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.900
The children themselves
are making up their own rules.

58
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.400
I need to get on, because I like carrots.

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.600
Now, are you all ready to go?

60
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.600
No, I have to get on because I can do this.

61
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.100
Here is mummy pig.

62
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.500
How are you getting on grandpa pig?

63
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.600
I … I ‘m confused.

64
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.100
These playground
rules are too complicated.

65
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.600
There is only one
rule grandpa pig, and that is,

66
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.900
everyone waits their turn.

67
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.700
What? Even the little ones?

68
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.600
Even the little ones.

69
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.000
What’s about the
very old ones like grandpa?

70
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.900
Even the very old ones like grandpa.

71
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.300
At the playground everyone has their turn.

72
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.300
Wee!
