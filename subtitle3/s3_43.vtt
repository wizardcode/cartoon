00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It is a lovely, sunny day.

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Peppa is playing with her friends.

3
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.643
It's Freddy Fox.

4
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.700
Hello, everyone!

5
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
Hello, Freddy!

6
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.600
Come on! Let's circle to the big hill.

7
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
Yeah!

8
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.800
Good morning, Mr Fox!

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
It's afternoon, Mr Pig!

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.700
Afternoon? Already?
My watch must have stopped.

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.400
My shop sells watches and clocks.

12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Let me see what I've got in a van.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
One grandfather?? clock!

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.800
It's a big big!

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
Good, isn't it?

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.142
It actually comes in a set of three.

17
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.200
Who's got the loudest bell?

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
I haven't got a bell.

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Oh!

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.600
But my dad will
have one in the back of his van.

21
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.900
Three clocks are much better than one.

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.300
Dad, have you got a bicycle bell, please?

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.000
How many do you want, son?

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.900
I only want one.

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.000
I took them in boxes of two.

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.556
Freddy Fox now has two bicycle bells.

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.968
Brilliant! Thanks, dad!

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.700
Dad gave me two bells.

29
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.900
Wow!

30
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.700
What else has your dad got in his van?

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.309
He's got everything!

32
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.600
What shall we play now?

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.200
Let's have a bicycle race!

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.900
With a big, shiny cup for the winner.

35
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.400
But where can me get a cup?

36
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400
Yes, where can we get a cup?

37
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.600
I'll see what I can do.

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.100
The best thing about
having your own cement mixer is thatâ€¦

39
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.000
Dad, have you
got a big shiny winner's cup

40
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.300
for our bicycle race, please?

41
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.800
How important a race is it?

42
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.000
It's very important.

43
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Will this do?

44
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.700
Well, thanks, dad. It's gold!

45
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.700
Yes, it's plastic gold!

46
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
One winner's cup is made of plastic gold!

47
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.800
Your daddy's van really has got everything!

48
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.200
Yep!

49
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.700
Let's race to Peppa's house!

50
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.700
Ready  Steady  Go!

51
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.100
Press this button and it just disappears!

52
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.300
Oh~Ah!

53
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.300
And if you push
this button, you can play CDs!

54
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.100
The friends have all finished together.

55
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.400
Everyone is a winner!

56
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.840
But we've only got one cup.

57
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200
My van has a winner's cup for everyone!

58
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.900
Hooray!

59
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
Mr Fox, is there anything
you don't have in your van?

60
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500
Try me!

61
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.600
Have you got a banjo?

62
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.638
Four or five-string.

63
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.800
You won't have a tree in your van?

64
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.891
Apple or pear?

65
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.800
I bet you haven't got a rocket in there.

66
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.300
Box is a foil.

67
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.000
What's about a chicken?

68
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.400
One chicken!

69
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
Mr Fox's van is magic!

70
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.300
It's a super van!

71
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.800
yes,it's. Come on
Freddy,we'd better get home!

72
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.000
Goodbye, everyone!

73
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Bye!

74
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.300
Have you got a bouncy castle?

75
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.300
Yep!

76
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.600
A garden shed?

77
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.039
Yep! I've got everything!

78
00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:13.387
Oh, I've got no petrol.

79
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.900
Mr Fox has
everything in his van except petrol.

80
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.889
Oh I need to get to the petrol station.

81
00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.585
I would tow you,
but I haven't got a tow rope.

82
00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:28.843
Oh, I have got plenty of them.
I do them in packs of five.

83
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.500
Can we come along, too?

84
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.683
Why not.

85
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.700
Daddy Pig is towing
Mr Fox's van to the petrol station.
