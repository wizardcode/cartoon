00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.200
Peppa and her family are at
 Granny and Grandpa Pig's house.

2
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.600
Today, I'm going to make 
apple and blackberry crumbles.

3
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.400
Yummy!

4
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.700
I need you bravest
 explorers to go and get the fruit.

5
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.000
Aye! Aye! Granny Pig!

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.100
We've got baskets for the apples.

7
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.100
And buckets for the blackberries.

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.700
First, the easy bit picking apples.

9
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.200
On the count of three, shake the tree.

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.200
One! Two! Three!

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Now for the blackberries.

12
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.800
Why don't we just have apple crumble?

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.900
Because
 blackberries are tasty too, Grandpa.

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.900
OK. Now the hard bit.

15
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Now that's what I call a blackberry bush.

16
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.800
This bush has been
  here since I was a little piggy.

17
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.900
It's an overgrown weed.

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200
I should've cut it down years ago.

19
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.600
Grandpa, why don't you like it?

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
I don't like the way it looks at me.

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.700
Silly Grandpa. It's just a harmless bush.

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.000
And it's covered in lovely blackberries.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.900
George has seen 
some really big juicy blackberries.

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.000
Careful George, or you might get tangled.

25
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I have a stick for
 picking hard-To-Reach blackberries.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.900
Clever Grandpa!

27
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.555
But the best
 blackberries are right at the very top.

28
00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:53.493
That's why I brought the ladder.

29
00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:56.019
Um, don't
 lean too far over, Mummy Pig.

30
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.020
Don't worry. I've been climbing this

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.575
Blackberry bush since I was a little girl.

32
00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.300
Yes, but you are not a little girl now.

33
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.600
I know what I'm doing.

34
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.500
Oh, dear! Mummy Pig has
 fallen into the blackberry bush.

35
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Mummy! Can you get out?

36
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.900
No, I'm stuck.

37
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.100
You're stuck in the 
thorny bush like Sleeping Beauty.

38
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.900
What?

39
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600
Once upon a time,

40
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.700
There was a
 princess called Sleeping Beauty.

41
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.700
One day she fell asleep in a thorny bush.

42
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.948
And she stayed there for a hundred years.

43
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.314
That's a nice story, Peppa.

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.500
It is Susie Sheep.

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.800
Hello, Peppa.

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.300
Hello, Susie.

47
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.515
My Mummy is in a blackberry bush.

48
00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:47.537
And she'll be there for a hundred years.

49
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.500
Like Sleeping Beauty?

50
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.500
And she'll be rescued by a
 handsome prince who will give her a kiss.

51
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.100
My Mummy is having an adventure.

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.500
I wish my mummy
 would have adventures like that.

53
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.900
Um, can someone think
 of a way to get me out of here?

54
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.500
Don't worry, Mummy.

55
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.500
In a hundred years 
a handsome prince will rescue you.

56
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.900
I'll be that handsome prince. Grandpa Pig,

57
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.400
May I borrow your pruning shears please?

58
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.700
Of course you may, Brave Sir Daddy Pig.

59
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.000
Stand back everyone.

60
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Take that you thorny bush you.

61
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.400
Hurray!

62
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.100
Oh, my prince.

63
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.200
My princess.

64
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.700
You were meant to stay
 in there for a hundred years!

65
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.100
That was quite long enough. Thank you.

66
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.000
Mummy is a blackberry bush.

67
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I thought this sort
 of thing only happened to me!

68
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Stand still while we pick you.

69
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.200
Let's take all this fruit back to Granny Pig.

70
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400
Granny! Granny! Mummy had an adventure!

71
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.600
And then Mummy fell in a bush.

72
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.100
She looked quite silly and she was going

73
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.100
Ah----! Help me! Help me!

74
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.800
And then Daddy came and rescued her.

75
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.300
The end.

76
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.334
Thank you, Peppa.

77
00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:20.755
I think we've all 
heard that story enough times now.

78
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.000
But it's funny.

79
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.500
I never want to see 
another blackberry in my life.

80
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.400
So you don't want to 
any apple and blackberry crumble then.

81
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.100
Well. Mmmm. Delicious.

82
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.500
Mummy Pig loves
 apple and blackberry crumble.

83
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Everyone loves 
apple and blackberry crumble.
