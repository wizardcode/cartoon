00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.100
Peppa and George are very
 excited today.They are going on holiday.

2
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.643
oh where is daddy?

3
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.187
He is bringing a secret surprise.

4
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.200
What’s that?

5
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.778
It’s a camper van.

6
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.342
We’ve borrowed it for a holiday.

7
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.600
This camper van has everything.
This button works the sink.

8
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.400
Wow!

9
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.700
And this button works the TV.

10
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400
What does this button do?

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.300
I am not sure. Maybe
don’t press it until we know.

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.400
Is everybody ready to go on holiday?

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Yes mummy pig.

14
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.700
Then let’s go!

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.900
We are going on holiday in a camper van.

16
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.500
Hohoho

17
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.600
En, this map is a bit tricky.

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.100
Daddy, we don’t want to get lost.

19
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.897
Don’t worry, Peppa. I’m an expert
in map reading. Oh, that’s strange.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.700
Are we lost?

21
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.500
Err yes.

22
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
It’s Granddad dog with Danny dog.

23
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.900
Hello Peppa,

24
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.000
Hello Danny. We’re lost.

25
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.700
Lost? Is your sat navi broken?

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400
sat navi?

27
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.300
You are driving a camper van T32 hundred,

28
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.400
set navi comes a standard.

29
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.277
Welcome to the car of the future.Ah,

30
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.296
so that’s what that button does.

31
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.348
Where are we going today?

32
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.500
The camper van is talking.

33
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.100
clever isn’t it. The
computer’s voice helps you find your way.

34
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.800
But how does
 it know where we want to go?

35
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.900
You tell it.

36
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Hello Mrs camper van.

37
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.200
Hello.

38
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.000
We’re going on a holiday.
Can you tell us the way?

39
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.553
Proceed on 
the current road in a straight line.

40
00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:27.000
Thanks for your help, Granddad dog.

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.700
You are welcome. Have a lovely holiday!

42
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.640
We’re going on a holiday in a camper van.

43
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.100
Danger, danger, oil is low.

44
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.700
What’s oil?

45
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.400
Oil helps engines to run smoothly.

46
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.900
Will the oil run out?

47
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.200
No, these warnings 
always give you plenty of time.

48
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.684
Oil is gone.

49
00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:57.955
Oh dear.

50
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.900
Luckily I’ve got a spare can of oil.

51
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.000
Well done, Daddy pig.

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.800
We simply pour 
the oil into the engine and oh …

53
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.900
What’s wrong?

54
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.900
There’s nothing in here.
The engine’s gone.

55
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It’s mummy sheep with Suzy sheep.

56
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.100
Hello Suzy!

57
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.500
Hello Peppa!

58
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.100
We’ve lost our engine.

59
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.000
Lost your engine?

60
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yes, it’s completely disappeared.

61
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I’d like to help, but I don’t
know a thing about engines.

62
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:39.101
I’m probably just being silly,
but this looks a bit like an engine?

63
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.201
Ah, yes, well-spotted Mummy sheep.

64
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.858
The camper van has its engine at the back.

65
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.600
There, that should be enough oil.
Thank you Mummy sheep!

66
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.415
You are welcome. Have a lovely holiday!

67
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.000
Are we near there yet?

68
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.800
Just up the next hill. You
have reached your destination.

69
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.400
Hooray!

70
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.000
Time for bed.

71
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.700
Where will we sleep?

72
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.575
Mummy pig and I will sleep on this bed.
And you two will sleep upstairs.

73
00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:23.251
But there isn’t an upstairs.

74
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.844
 watch this.

75
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.273
The camper van’s roof is lifting up.

76
00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.367
The camper van is just like our little house.

77
00:04:35.514 --> 00:04:39.560
While we are on holiday,
it is our little house.

78
00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:42.160
Goodnight my little piggies.

79
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.100
Goodnight.
