00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.400
It is play time at school.

2
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.800
Peppa and her friends
 are running around having fun.

3
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.900
Oh, that hurts.

4
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200
Are you right, Peppa?

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.900
I 've hurt my knee.

6
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.300
Madame Gazelle, Peppa has fallen over.

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.704
You just grazed your knee, Peppa.

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.105
First, Madame Gazelle cleans 
Peppa' knee. then she puts a plaster on it.

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.000
Does it feel any better?

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.300
Yes. Thank you.

11
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.300
Now, children you may have
 noticed that Pedro Pony isn't here today.

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.900
Is he late again?

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.200
No, Susie. Pedro is in hospital.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
Woooo

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.676
And today, we are going to visit him.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
This is the hospital.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.600
Peppa and her 
friends have come to visit Pedro.

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
Remember, Children, stay close to me.

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200
I don't want you get lost.

20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.400
Yes, Madame Gazelle!

21
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.200
Excuse me, Mr. Bull
 which way is the children's ward?

22
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.400
Down the steps,

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.500
double doors, right,
 left, right along the corridor.

24
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.700
Up the stairs, third on your left.

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.105
Or you could just take the lift.

26
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.056
Children's ward!

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.100
Pedro will be asleep. 
Sick people do a lot of sleeping.

28
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.500
Hello, everyone!

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.300
Hello, Pedro.

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.800
Why aren't 
you asleep? You don't look sick.

31
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.800
I broke my leg and 
they put it in this plaster cast.

32
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.100
The plaster cast 
helps Pedro's leg get better.

33
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.300
I grazed my knee and I got a plaster too.

34
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.900
Wow, do you 
want to draw on my plaster cast?

35
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.500
Yes, please.

36
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.600
The children are all
 doing drawings on Pedro's plaster cast.

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.000
I am drawing a football.

38
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.800
I've drawn some beautiful flowers.

39
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200
Mr. Potato.

40
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
A parrot.

41
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800
And I'v drawn a muddy puddle.

42
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.700
Wow, thanks everyone.

43
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600
You can draw on my plaster, too.

44
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.500
OK, I will draw a little flower.

45
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.600
Thank you. Pedro.

46
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.100
Pedro, what's it like being in hospital?

47
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.500
It is great!

48
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.200
What the nurse is like?

49
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.876
They give me stickers 

50
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.653
and they come
 whenever I press this button.

51
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.100
Who's that? I wonder?

52
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.400
Could it be Pedro?

53
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.600
What do you want, Pedro?
 We are very busy.

54
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.200
I've got a bit of an itch.

55
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.600
Even if your leg is itching,

56
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.700
we can't take the
 cast off until your leg is better.

57
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.700
It is not my leg that is itching. It is my ear.

58
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.500
Is it better?

59
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.900
Yes, thank you.

60
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.400
Lunch time!

61
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.800
What would you like to eat today, Pedro?

62
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.900
Can I have spaghetti 
and sponge pudding, please?

63
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.600
You get your dinner in bed?

64
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.800
Yes.

65
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.600
That looks tasty.

66
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.400
Doctor Brown Bear has
 come to see how Pedro is doing.

67
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.200
How are we, today, Pedro?

68
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.681
My ear is a bit itchy. Just here.

69
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.772
I say you are almost better.

70
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.000
Visiting time is over.

71
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.500
Bye, Pedro!

72
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.800
Bye, everyone.

73
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.600
Get well soon, Pedro!

74
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.448
Yes, Madame Gazelle.

75
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.200
It is another school day.

76
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.700
Peppa and her friends 
are playing in the playground.

77
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.400
Madame Gazelle, my plaster had fallen off.

78
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.000
Can I have another one?

79
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.400
You don't need a plaster, Peppa.

80
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200
Your knee is better.

81
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.000
Oh, yes.

82
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.400
Hello, everyone. Pedro Pony is back.

83
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.700
Oh, hello, Pedro. Where is your plaster cast?

84
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.400
They take it off because my leg is better.

85
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.900
Is your leg stronger now?

86
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.900
It's stronger than
 it was before. It is a super leg.

87
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.800
Can you run on it?

88
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.053
Watch this!

89
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.904
Pedro likes running around having fun.

90
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800
Everybody likes running around having fun.
