00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.800
Grandpa pig is taking
Peppa and George on a boat trip.

2
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.500
Polly parrot is going, too.

3
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Grandpa pig,
have you got your mobile phone?

4
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.035
Yes, granny pig.

5
00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:35.400
Don’t drop it in the water.

6
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.100
No, granny pig.

7
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.500
Is it switched on？

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.600
Yes, granny pig.Bye!

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.900
Bye-bye!

10
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.800
Here is granddad dog.

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.400
Aha there.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.155
Lovely day to go sailing.

13
00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:54.517
I would go, too.
But my boat needs to clean.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.200
I don’t know why you
bother cleaning that rusty boat.

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.700
I’m surprised it’s still afloat.

16
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.200
This rusty boat
will still be afloat long after

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.255
your old tin boat has
sunk to the bottom of the river.

18
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.100
Granddad dog is
grandpa pig’s very best friend.

19
00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:18.131
Boat steam ahead! Goodbye!

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600
I am the captain of this boat,

21
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.500
and when the captain tells you
to do something, you must do it.

22
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.300
Aye, aye Captain!

23
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.800
Aye, aye, Captain!

24
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.600
Polly parrot copies
everything that they said.

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200
George, raise  the flag.

26
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
George, raise the flag.

27
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.300
Peppa, ring the bell.

28
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.400
Grandpa, can I be the captain, please?

29
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.400
OK. But as a captain,
you must wear this hat.

30
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.900
Now Peppa is the captain, and
everyone must do what she says.

31
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.700
Ring the bell. Turn that wheel.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.000
Aye aye, Captain Peppa.

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.700
Jump up and down.

34
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.100
Captain Peppa is a bit bossy.

35
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.600
Perhaps I should be the captain again.

36
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.000
We don’t want a crash into anything.

37
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.600
Steering the boat can be tricky Luckily,

38
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.000
I’m good at steering.

39
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.834
Oh dear. Grandpa pig’s boat
has crashed into a little island.

40
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.400
Grandpa, we’re stuck.

41
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.300
I’ll ring granny pig. She can get help.

42
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.900
Wow, oh. Grandpa pig has
dropped his phone in the water.

43
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.300
Granny pig speaking. Hello? Hello. Hello.

44
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.200
Somehow, we need to
get a message to granny.

45
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.000
Message to granny.

46
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Polly can fly to granny.

47
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Good idea, Peppa! And I
can teach Polly what to say.

48
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.900
Grandpa pig says,

49
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.800
Grandpa pig says,

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.400
Help, help!

51
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.600
There you see easy peasy.

52
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.400
Grandpa pig says easy peasy.

53
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.366
You silly old bird.

54
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.800
Hello, Polly. What are you doing here?

55
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.900
Grandpa pig says,

56
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.200
What does grandpa pig say?

57
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.800
You silly old bird.

58
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.500
Oh!

59
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.900
Help, help!

60
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.898
Goodness me, grandpa must need help!

61
00:03:49.113 --> 00:03:49.901
Granddad dog.

62
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
Hello, granny pig.

63
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.500
Grandpa pig needs help.
Please, could you rescue him?

64
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Madam, I would be delighted.

65
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300
Hurray！

66
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.800
Aha there.
Do you need rescuing, captain?

67
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.600
En, maybe.

68
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.100
Would you like my rusty
old boat to rescue you?

69
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.300
Yes, please, granddad dog.

70
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.700
Catch this, captain.

71
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.500
Aye aye, skippe.

72
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.200
Granddad dog is
grandpa pig’s very best friend.

73
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.600
Granny, did Polly
tell you we needed help?

74
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.500
Yes, Polly is a very clever parrot.

75
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.800
Say I’m a clever parrot, woof woof!

76
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.499
I’m a clever parrot, woof woof!
