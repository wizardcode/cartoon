00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.080
Peppa and her family are
going for a drive to the mountains.

2
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.607
Are we nearly there yet?

3
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
Not yet, Peppa.

4
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.800
Oh…

5
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.300
let’s play a game.

6
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.412
We each have to
spot a car of our favorite color.

7
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.043
My favorite color is green.

8
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.027
Mine is orange.

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.388
Mine is red. George,
what’s your favorite color?

10
00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:44.400
Blue.

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.181
George’s favorite color is blue.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Let’s see which color car comes along first.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.000
Ok!

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800
Here is Candy Cat in her green car.

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Ho, ho, ho…green!
That’s my favorite color. I win!

16
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.400
Hello, Candy!

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
Meow! Hello, Peppa!

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.815
Here is Danny Dog in
Granddad Dog’s breakdown truck.

19
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.300
Orange, so I win!

20
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.600
Hello, Danny!

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
Woof, woof, hello, Peppa!

22
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.300
Ho, ho, ho. Here is another car.

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.500
It’s Suzy. Hello, Suzy!

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.700
Baa, baa. Hello, Peppa.

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.800
Blue!

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.500
Yes, George. It’s a blue car, so you win!

27
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.700
Ho, ho, ho.

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.300
Oh, this is a silly game.

29
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.400
There isn’t any red car anyway?

30
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.100
There is one red car, Peppa.

31
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.200
Where?

32
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Ho, ho, ho…What color is our car?

33
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.680
Ah, it’s red. I win! I win!

34
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.400
Ho, ho, ho…

35
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.170
The family have arrived at the mountains.

36
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.733
We’ll have a fantastic
view when we get to the top.

37
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.100
We are here.

38
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.400
Great!

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.600
Look at the lovely Sunny view!

40
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.300
Oh, dear. It is started to rain.

41
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.209
Where is the lovely view?

42
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.635
Ah, there is the lovely view.

43
00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:14.800
It’s Miss Rabbit’s ice cream store.

44
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.100
Hello, Miss Rabbit!

45
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.800
Hello, Daddy Pig!

46
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.000
Four ice creams, please!

47
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.800
What flavors would you like?

48
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.100
Mint, orange,
strawberry and blueberry, please.

49
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.141
OK!

50
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.200
Look what I’ve got!

51
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.700
Icecream!

52
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.100
There are favorite colors.

53
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.100
That’s right. Green for me!

54
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.600
Orange for me!

55
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.100
Strawberry red for me!

56
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.900
And George’s is…

57
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.000
Blue!

58
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.900
Ho, ho, ho…yummy

59
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.500
Look, the sun has come out!

60
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.100
And look what else has come out?

61
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.900
A rainbow!

62
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800
Peppa and George love rainbows!

63
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.800
A rainbow only comes out when
it’s rainy and sunny at the same time!

64
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.000
Wow…

65
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.300
It’s got all our favorite colors in it.

66
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.300
Yes. Red, and orange, and green, and blue.

67
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.600
And do you know what you
find in the end of the rainbow?

68
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.100
No!

69
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.700
You find treasure.

70
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.000
Oh, can we go to find the treasure now?

71
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
OK! The end of the rainbow
looks like just on the next hill.

72
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.100
Let’s go. Wee.

73
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.400
It’s a rainy sunny day,
the rainbow is here to play.

74
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.820
Rainbow, rainbow, red and orange
and yellow and green and purple and blue.

75
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.819
Rainbow, rainbow.
It’s a rainy sunny day!

76
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.100
Here we are!

77
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.200
Oh, where are the rainbow gone?

78
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500
It’s moved to the next hill.

79
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
You tricky rainbow.

80
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.300
Quick! Let’s catch it.

81
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.300
Rainbow, rainbow, it’s a rainy sunny day!

82
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.300
It’s stopped raining!

83
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.300
And the rainbow is gone!

84
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.500
Waa…

85
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Don’t worry, George. Maybe the
rainbow has left some treasure behind.

86
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.700
There is something over here.

87
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.100
Have you found the rainbow’s treasure?

88
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.500
Yes. I have.

89
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.400
A big muddy puddle!

90
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.500
Great!

91
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.600
This is the best rainbow treasure ever.

92
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.800
Ha, ha, ha…
