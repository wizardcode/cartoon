It's fun having carrots
for breakfast, mummy rabbit.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.200
Yes, we always have carrots for breakfast.

5
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.600
I could eat carrots all day,

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.200
But I'd better go to work.

You do, mummy.

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000
And you can help
me by tidying up your toys please

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
Before someone trips over them.

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.700
That would be my sister.

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.100
Hello!

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.700
Hello, Miss Rabbit!

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.800
Auntie!

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.000
I can't stop long.
I've got lots of work to do today!

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.300
I've got the supermarket

Miss rabbit has
tripped over one of Richard's toys.

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.500
Oh, my ankle. I can still hop to work.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700
No, you stay here and get better.

27
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.100
But I've got so much work to do.

28
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
I'll do your work for you.
Which job is first?

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.500
The supermarket.

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.700
OK, Rebecca, look after your auntie.

arrived at the supermarket.

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.200
Thank goodness!
You are here, Miss Rabbit.

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.500
Miss Rabbit is ill.
I'll be doing her job today.

35
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.300
Are you not Miss Rabbit?

36
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.800
No, I'm her sister,
Mummy Rabbit. Is this where I sit?

37
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.600
Eh, yes. Have you
ever worked at check out before?

38
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600
No.

39
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.100
How much is this?

40
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.500
Oh, I don't know.

41
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.100
I've got a fare chart.

42
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.300
Do you take book tokens?

43
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.800
Can I pay with a card?

44
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.400

46
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.700
Don't worry.

47
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.400
I'm only a pretend nurse.

48
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.700
Stick your tongue out and say Ah~~

It's mummy rabbit. Is everything ok?

53
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.100
Yes.

54
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.800
Good. Because
this job could take me all day.

55
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.100
What's about Miss Rabbit's other jobs?

56
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.820
We need more help.

58
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.800
Daddy, why are you buying an ice-Cream?

59
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.000
Oh, Peppa, I was on the way to the gym,

60
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
What I thought
an ice-Cream would be nice.

61
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Miss Rabbit is ill.
You've got to sell the ice-Cream today.

62
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.000
Oh, I am an expert of ice-Cream.

63
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Can I have a cherry ice-Cream?

64
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.800
Eh, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, banana,

65
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.300
With ~~~and strawberry please.

66
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.914
Strawberry. Oh, it's melted.
How about ice-Cream soup, instead?

68
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.400
Miss Rabbit is ill,
can you drive a bus today?

69
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.400
Of course, Peppa.

70
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500
All aboard.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.900
Can you rescue me, please?

74
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.339
I'll be straight there!

75

We would like to apologize for any

76
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.300

been caused to your journey.

77
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.200
Driving a bus is quite hard.

78
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.600
Selling ice-Cream is quite hard.

79
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.600
Running a
supermarket check-Out is quite hard.

80
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.500
Eh, I'm feeling better. Can I get up now?

81
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.500
No, you must lie
very still, but please keep breathing.

82
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.300
Are you feeling any better, Miss Rabbit?

83
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.800
It's not easy doing all your jobs.

84
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.500
It's not easy
looking after your little bunnies.

85
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.900
You will be back
to work tomorrow, won't you?

86
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.930
Yes, and you'll be
back at home, won't you?

87
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.901
Yes.
