00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.200
It is a lovely sunny morning.

2
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.900
And Daddy Pig is reading his news paper.

3
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.800
Daddy what are you doing?

4
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.500
I'm reading the newspaper.

5
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400
You are making a funny sound.

6
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200
I'm whistling! Uh!

7
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.800
Whistling is fun. You should try it!

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.500
I don't know how to.

9
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
It's easy! Just put
your lips together and blow!

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Try making a smaller" o" shape.

11
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
Like this!

12
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
And then you could whistle a tune.

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.700
Oh, I've got the wrong kind of mouth.

14
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.400
Your mouth is fine!
You just need to practice.

15
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
It's impossible!

16
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.600
It takes time to learn
how to do important things

17
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.500
like riding a bicycle or playing the piano.

18
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.500
It took me years to
learn how to wiggle my ears.Wow!

19
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.321
Mommy Pig is in
the kitchen making cookies.

20
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.700
What are you doing, Peppa?

21
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.100
I'm learning to whistle.

22
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.300
Oh, I see.

23
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.600
Mommy, can you whistle?

24
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.404
I don't know. I've never tried.

25
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.006
It takes a lot of practice.Oh, yes!

26
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.500
Mommy Pig can whistle.

27
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.700
You can whistle
because you are old, mommy.

28
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Thank you, Peppa.

29
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.000
George is in the bedroom,
playing with his toy rocket.

30
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.300
George, I'm learning to whistle.

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.300
You make an "o "
shape with your mouth and blow.

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.500
Don't worry George.

33
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500
It's almost
impossible like wiggling your ears.

34
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.700
George can wiggle his ears.

35
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.700
Whistling is harder.

36
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700
George can whistle!

37
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.800
What's wrong, Peppa?

38
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.400
I can't whistle but everybody else can.

39
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.900
Never mind. I'm making cookies.

40
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.700
Would you like to lip a spoon?

41
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.500
No. Thank you. Mommy

42
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Can I ring Suzie sheep instead?

43
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.425
Ok Peppa

44
00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:05.501
Hello Mrs. Pig.

45
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.600
Hello Mrs. Sheep.

46
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000
Can Peppa talk to Suzie please?

47
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.100
Hello Suzie.

48
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.400
Hello Peppa.

49
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.900
What're you doing?

50
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.400
I'm learning
to whistle but I can't do it yet.

51
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.000
That sounds hard!

52
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200
It's impossible.

53
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.700
Uhâ€¦Can you whistle Suzie?No.

54
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.700
Oh good!

55
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.900
I mean that's
so difficult whistle. But good.

56
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.700
Because I can't whistle.

57
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.900
What's whistling anyway?

58
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.000
You put your lips together and blow.

59
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Like this?

60
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:45.001
Hello? Peppa?

61
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.700
Good cookies are ready!

62
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.800
Oh! Goody! Cookies!

63
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.000
They will be hot!

64
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.600
You should blow on them first.

65
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.100
Do you not want cookie Peppa?

66
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.400
No, thank you mommy.

67
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400
I think I might go outside
and be on my own for a little bit.

68
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.000
Can you whistle yet?

69
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.100
It's no use daddy.

70
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.900
I'm never going to whistle. Ever!

71
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.900
Have you been practicing?

72
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.800
Yes, lots.. But it doesn't work!

73
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.000
You need a little rest, Peppa.

74
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Here have a cookie.
It's hot. You should blow.

75
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.900
Oh! What's that?

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.578
It sounded like a whistle to me!

77
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.500
What a lovely tune!

78
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.300
Peppa has learned how to whistle!

79
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.340
I can whistle!
