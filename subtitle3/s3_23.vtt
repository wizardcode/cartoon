00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.800
It is a lovely sunny morning.

2
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.997
Daddy pig is driving to work in his car.

3
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.300
Breakfast time, Goldie.

4
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Mummy pig is feeding Goldie the fish.

5
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.700
Mummy, Goldie isn’t eating.

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.100
Oh, maybe she’s not feeling very well.

7
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.822
Let’s phone Doctor Hamster the vet.

8
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.900
Doctor Hamster the vet speaking.

9
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.900
Hello, Doctor Hamster.
Goldie fish is not eating.

10
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900
And she looks sad.

11
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.261
Oh, you better bring
Goldie to see me right way.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.115
Oh, Daddy took the car. 
How do we get to the vet?

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.300
We can take the bus.

14
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.600
Oh, goody!

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.000
This is the bus stop.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.400
The timetable says the
next bus will be here at 10 o’clock.

17
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
What time is it now?

18
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100
10 o’clock.

19
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.900
Hurray!

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.400
How many tickets?

21
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800
One Mummy ticket and two little piggies.

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.900
And one fish please.

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.768
The fish goes free.

24
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:30.901
Hold tight!

25
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Mr. Bull is waiting for the bus.

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.700
Moo… One ticket to the music shop please.

27
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Hello, Mr. Bull. We
are taking Goldie to the vet.

28
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.220
Oh, dear! Feeling poor, aren’t Goldie?

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.000
She can’t talk. She is a fish.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.700
Of course. Eh…

31
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700
Maybe she’d like
to hear a tune on my tuba.

32
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.300
It sounds funny.

33
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.600
That’s why I’m going to
the music shop to get it mended.

34
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.400
Woo!

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.600
Mrs. Sheep, Mrs. Cat,
Mr. Zebra and Madame Gazelle

36
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.000
have got on the bus.

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.642
Four tickets to the supermarket, please.

38
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.300
Hello, Madame Gazelle,
we’re taking Goldie to the vet's.

39
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.641
Oh, is Goldie not well?

40
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.200
She likes you！

41
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.800
The wheels on the bus go round and round,

42
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.600
round and round, round and round,

43
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600
the wheels on the bus
go round and round, all day long!

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Supermarket!

45
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.800
Bye!

46
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.400
Music shop!

47
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.300
Bye!

48
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.700
Last stop, the vet!

49
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.029
The vet helps sick pets get better.

50
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.300
Ah, is this the sad little fish that won’t eat?

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.247
Yes, watch this!

52
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.300
Goldie is eating the food.

53
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.900
Oh, she didn’t eat at home.

54
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.100
Maybe Goldie was bored at home.

55
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.600
The interesting journey has cheered her up.

56
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.300
Oh~

57
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.000
You have a very healthy,
happy fish. She’s lovely.

58
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.200
Thank you, Doctor Hamster.

59
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.200
Mummy pig, Peppa and
George are going home on the bus.

60
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.100
Mr. Bull is going
home with his mended tuba.

61
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.500
It is just as good as new!

62
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.200
Hehe……

63
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.629
Madame Gazelle and her friends
are going home with their shopping.

64
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.300
I see Goldie the fish is happy again.

65
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.600
Yes, it was the bus
ride that made her better.

66
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.300
The fish in the bowl
swims round and round, round

67
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.900
and round, round and round,

68
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.900
the fish in the bowl swims
round and round, all day long!

69
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.600
Haha……

70
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.700
Hello, where have you been?

71
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.700
We took Goldie to
the vet. And now she is better.

72
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.300
Oh dear, Goldie has a cough.

73
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.500
I think we should take
Goldie to the vet again tomorrow.

74
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.100
I can drive you in the car.

75
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.800
No, Daddy. We want
to go on the bus. It’s fun!

76
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.500
Okay, we will go on the bus.

77
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.500
Hurray!

78
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.500
Everyone loves going
on the bus, especially Goldie the fish.

79
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.900
The fish in the bowl
swims round and round,

80
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.600
round and round, round
and round, the fish in the bowl

81
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.600
swims round and round, all day long!
