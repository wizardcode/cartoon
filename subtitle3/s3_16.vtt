00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.100
Today is Danny Dog’s Birthday.

2
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.300
He is having a party.

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.000
Yoo hoho!

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.025
Everyone has come dressed as a pirate.

5
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.660
Pedro Pony is dressed
up as a cowboy. Eee hi!

6
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.461
Ahoy, there, we hearties.

7
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.800
It is Granddad dog dressed up as a pirate.

8
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.700
Hello, Granddad dog.

9
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.300
Call me Dog Beard.

10
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.900
Hello, Dog Beard.

11
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.900
xxxxxxxxxx

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Why is he talking funny?

13
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
That’s pirate talk.

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.200
If you want to play
my pirate game, say “Arrr~”

15
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.600
Arrr~

16
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.800
Is it a dangerous game?

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.400
No, Pedro.

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.400
Granddad Dog has promised
me. It will be a very safe game.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.500
But it will be exciting.
So who wants to play?

20
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.900
Arrr~

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.527
Here be the plan.

22
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.000
Here was a heap of gold
which was mined by Kright.???

23
00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:30.000
What?

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900
Pirate talk is a bit difficult to understand.

25
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.100
Captain Hog took my treasure.

26
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.700
Oh!

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.500
Oh you.

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.200
The Captain Hog is a fearsome pirate.

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Some of you may have
already known him as Grandpa Pig.

30
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.300
Ah, Grandpa Pig!

31
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.900
The game is to go to
Captain Pig’s hideout and

32
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.600
get back my treasure without being caught.

33
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.800
Hurrah!

34
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.716
Everyone is excited
to be playing a pirate game.

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.000
Hello, Grandpa Pig. We are on our way.

36
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.500
Jolly good.

37
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.200
Grandpa Pig and Parrot
are gardening the pirate treasure.

38
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.600
Xxxxxxxxxxx

39
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.700
What does that mean?

40
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.900
Run to the boat.

41
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.447
Yo hoho.

42
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.300
Hold there.

43
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.000
Put your life jackets up.

44
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.900
On Granddad Dog’s boat,

45
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
all the children must wear life jackets.

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.800
That scurvy Dog
Beard should be here by now.

47
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.300
Here is a nice cup of tea, Grandpa pig.

48
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.300
Oh, thank you. Granny Pig.

49
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300
At last, are we already now?

50
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
Mr. Dog Beard, I need to go to the toilet.

51
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.400
And me.

52
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
What can be keeping them?

53
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.400
Hello, Granddad Dog. I
thought you said you were on your way.

54
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.600
Yes, yes. We are almost there.
It’s taking a while to get my crew together.

55
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.500
Anchor’s away. Full sail.

56
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.815
Ahoy, Dog beard.

57
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.700
Land ahoy!

58
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.000
The children have
arrived at Grandpa Pig’s orchard.

59
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The game is to get that
treasure without being caught.

60
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.300
Hurrah for the pirates!

61
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.800
Shush! Mommy.

62
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.700
I hope there are no pirates around here,

63
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.200
trying to take my lovely treasure.

64
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.200
Peppa and her friends have
got the coins without being caught.

65
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.000
It’s chocolate coins.

66
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.200
Everybody loves chocolate coins.

67
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.900
Yum, yum, yum.

68
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.200
Aha, got you.

69
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000
Granddad dog has been caught.

70
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.600
Try and take my treasure, would you?

71
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.900
It’s mine. I want it very square.

72
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.800
No, no. You didn’t.

73
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.200
Oh, yes, I did.

74
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.300
Thank you,

75
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.100
Captain Hog and Dog
Beard for the lovely pirate game.

76
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.400
Oh, you are very welcome.

77
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.600
Eh, oh yes. It’s been lots of fun.

78
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.200
Happy birthday, Danny!

79
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.600
It’s been the best pirate party ever!

80
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.000
Arrrr…
