00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
It is bed time for Peppa and George.

2
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.600
Good night, my little piggies!

3
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.524
Granny and 
grandpa pig have come for dinner.

4
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.300
Hello!

5
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.800
Where are Peppa and George?

6
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.900
They are asleep.

7
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.407
Oh, but I so want 
to see them, can I take a peek?

8
00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:41.383
Ok, granny pig, but be very quiet.

9
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.800
Granny pig!

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.400
Hello, my little
 darlings! You should be asleep!

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.000
Tell us a story!

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Ok, but only if you 
promise to go straight back to sleep.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Ok, I’ll just sleep after the story.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
All right. Once upon a time, there was

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A little boy called
 Pedro Pony, and he found some magic bean.

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.007
Oh! Yes. Now Pedra planted the bean 

17
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:19.235
and it grew into an enormous 
bean stalk that went high into the sky.

18
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.900
That’s right!

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.800
Pedro climbed to the 
top of that bean sprout and found a

20
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.814
A horrible big giant. 
But I don’t want that. I want a princess!

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400
Oh, yes! There he
 found a beautiful princess Peppa.

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.300
Haha~

23
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600
And Sir George, the brave knight.

24
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.600
And a cook, who made 
the most delicious food ever.

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.700
Mummy pig, daddy pig and 
grandpa pig are waiting to eat dinner.

26
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.205
I’ll go and see what’s keeping granny pig.

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.200
What’s next in the story?

28
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.400
Naughty granny pig! 
You woke the little ones.

29
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.661
We promised to sleep 
when the story ends, grandpa.

30
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.900
I’m good at ending stories.
 granny pig. And you go down stairs.

31
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.000
I won’t be long.

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There’s a boy.
a bean stalk. a beautiful princess.

33
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.100
a brave knight. and a 
cook who makes the lovely dinner.

34
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.328
Well, after they ate the 
lovely dinner, everyone fell asleep, the end.

35
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.400
Then they all 
woke up and along came a wizard.

36
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.300
A wizard?

37
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.100
Yes, a wizard who 
was going to do a big magic show.

38
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.600
Ah, but――

39
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.426
Then, along came a scary dragon.

40
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.700
Granny pig, mummy pig and 
daddy pig are still waiting to eat dinner.

41
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600
That bit time
 story doesn’t seem to be working.

42
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.397
I’m the expert in telling bedtime
 stories, I’ll have them sleeping in no time.

43
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.000
Ahhh, a scary dragon!

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.660
Peppa, Gorge, back to bed!

45
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.100
But grandpa hasn’t 
finished the story yet, daddy.

46
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.100
I’ll finish the story. 
I’ll be done in a minute.

47
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.200
Ok, there is a boy, a bean stalk, a castle,

48
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.200
a beautiful princess, a brave knight, a cook,

49
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.760
a wizard and a scary dragon.

50
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.100
And a very hungry king.

51
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.000
So they all had a big 
dinner and lived happily ever after

52
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.400
The end.

53
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.443
Then, they had a party! 
And all their friends came. 

54
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.375
Right, I think I’d better sort this out.

55
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.400
Hohohoho~

56
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.700
Daddy pig!

57
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.800
They are almost asleep.

58
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
Thank you. I’ll take over now.

59
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.200
You have to finish the story, mummy.

60
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200
Ok, quickly now. Tell me what’s happened.

61
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.152
Once upon the time, 
in olden days, a long time ago……

62
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.754
Mummy pig has
 been up there for a long time.

63
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.800
I can hear snoring.

64
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.500
At last! Peppa and Gorge are asleep.

65
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Then they all lived 
happily ever after. The end.

66
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.000
Peppa, George!

67
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.800
Shi――Mummy is asleep!

68
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.800
Hohohoho, it looks like princess

69
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.900
Peppa is the
 best to tell the bedtime stories.

70
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.911
That’s right. I am!
