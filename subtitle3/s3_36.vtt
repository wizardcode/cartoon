00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.100
Peppa, George and Danny are 
having a day out on granddad dog's boat.

2
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.200
Can we go to pirate island today?

3
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.100
Yes, Danny. But first,

4
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.500
We've got to deliver
 supplies to my friend Grampy Rabbit.

5
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Where does Grampy Rabbit live?

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.100
On a rock!

7
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.800
On a  rock?

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.100
Yes.In fact, light house!

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.200
Wow~

10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
Aye aye there,  maty!

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.500
I've brought your supplies.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.700
Oh. Thank you, granddad dog.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.000
I got my crew with me today.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.400
Danny. Peppa.and George.

15
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.900
Visitors.

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.300
I have not had visitors in many a moment.

17
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
I get a bit lonely.

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.600
I just sea and sky for company.

19
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.500
How long have you been here?

20
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.900
Since Tuesday.

21
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.600
Oh~

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.900
I've got tails? to tell.

23
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.200
If you like to hear?

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
No thanks.

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Yes, please.

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.000
Well. There's the sea under sky, and ……

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.400
I'm learning the banjo.

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.600
Would you like to hear a song?

29
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
No, thanks. yes, please.

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.839
I got up this morning. 
The sea was still there, so was the sky.

31
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.900
The sea, the sky, the sea, the sky.

32
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.400
Here's your cheese.

33
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.100
Oh, hi~ mr cheese.

34
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.700
And a new book!

35
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.300
How to run a light house. 
Oh, that will come handy.

36
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.000
Why is your house called a lighthouse?

37
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300
I'll show you, peppa.

38
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.200
The staircase goes around 
and around to the very top of the lighthouse.

39
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.600
Round, and round, and round!

40
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
It's called a lighthouse,
 because it has this big light at the top.

41
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.200
Wow~

42
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.200
It shines through 
the dark helping sailors to find their way.

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.200
And when there is foggy,
  I use this fog horn. FOG~

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.200
That's loud!

45
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.800
No fog today. Just sea and sky.

46
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.000
The stories I could tell you.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.100
No, thank you. We've got to go.

48
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300
We are sailing to Pirate Island.

49
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.500
Goodbye  Grampy Rabbit.

50
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.600
Enjoy the sea and  the sky!

51
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.300
We will.

52
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.000
Granddad dog's 
boat has arrived at the island.

53
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.300
Look! Our sand castle is still there.

54
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.600
Let's play hide and seek.

55
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.500
OK. One, two, three……

56
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.700
There're not many
 places to hide on pirate island.

57
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.700
Ready or not?
 Here I come. Found you.oh

58
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.600
Now, where is George

59
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600
Granddad dog can't find George anywhere.

60
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.500
I give up. Where's he?Boo!

61
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.600
George was hiding behind granddad dog.

62
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.532
Clever George! 
Let's set off home before it gets dark.

63
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.700
Oh~ it is getting dark!

64
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.551
Don't worry!The light from Grampy Rabbit 's
 lighthouse will show us the way home.

65
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.100
Grampy Rabbit is ready for bed.

66
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.461
Oh~ My new book
 "how to run a lighthouse" chapter 1.

67
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.744
Oh~ I'll read the rest tomorrow.
 Better turn the light out.

68
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.184
Oh! Where did the light go?

69
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.643
Do you know what time it is?

70
00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:50.023
I've just turned the light out.

71
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.900
Yes, we know.

72
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.700
Could you turn the big light on again?

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.500
Oh, sorry hurray！

74
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.100
It's getting foggy.

75
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.000
I can't see the light anymore.

76
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.600
It's us again.

77
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.900
Could you sound the fog horn?

78
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.200
Oh~ FOG.

79
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.300
I can hear something.

80
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.900
Grampy Rabbit is guiding them home.

81
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.400
His voice is a fog horn!

82
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.000
This way, this way home.

83
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.800
The parents are here to pick up the children.

84
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.300
Have you had a lovely time?

85
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.800
We went to pirate island.

86
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.400
And to a lighthouse!

87
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.100
Grampy Rabbit' s
lighthouse guided us home safely.

88
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.200
That's nice.

89
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200
Grampy Rabbit 
sang a song. Would you like to hear it?

90
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.400
No, thanks.yes, please.

91
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.600
I got up this morning.

92
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.319
The sea was still there....
