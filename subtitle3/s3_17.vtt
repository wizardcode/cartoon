00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.585
Peppa and her family are
watching Mr. Potato on television.

2
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.618
I love watching
programs about keeping fit.

3
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.724
Now, here are some lovely drawings .

4
00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:33.928
I’ve been sent.

5
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:35.896
This is an apple.

6
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Remember, eating fruit and
vegetables helps you stay fit.

7
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.400
I’m good at eating fruit and vegetables.

8
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.200
And exercise is important.

9
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Today you can see me
open a new sports centre in town.

10
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.400
Mummy, can we go and see Mr. Potato?

11
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.200
It’s a long way to go
to see a potato, Peppa.

12
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.400
It’s not any old potato.

13
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
This is Mr. Potato.

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.084
Can we go and see him,
mummy? Please!All right.Hurray!

15
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Everyone has come to see Mr.
Potato open a new sports centre.

16
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.900
Look, it’s Mr. Potato!

17
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.900
Mr. Potato! Oh, it’s just Peppa.Oh…

18
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.000
Hello everyone!

19
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.500
Hello Peppa.

20
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.700
Suzy thought you were Mr. Potato.

21
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.900
I don’t look like Mr. Potato.

22
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.400
No, you’re much too big.

23
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
Mr. Potato is bigger than me.

24
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.100
No, he is not. He is a potato.

25
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.400
And potatoes are this big.

26
00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:51.957
Here is Mr. Potato!

27
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.700
Mr. Potato has come to town.

28
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.887
Please welcome your
friend and mine, Mr. Potato!

29
00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:02.912
Hurray!

30
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.500
Wow, that’s a big potato.

31
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.351
I declare this sports centre open!

32
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.500
Fantastic!

33
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500
We must all exercise
and eat fruit and vegetables.

34
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Which one should we eat, Mr. Potato?

35
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.600
Apples, oranges, carrots, tomatoes…

36
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.100
Potatoes!Umm…

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.200
Why aren’t you small,
like a normal potato?Umm…

38
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200
Because he is not a
normal potato. He’s got legs.

39
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Normal potatoes don’t
have legs. He’s a super potato!

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.800
We watch your show every morning.

41
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.300
Very good!

42
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.300
And remember to send
me your drawings.We will!

43
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.500
Peppa and her friends are at play groups.

44
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.742
Children, today we will do
drawings for Mr. Potato.Hurray!

45
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.700
I’m drawing a pineapple.

46
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.700
I’m drawing a carrot.

47
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.100
Very good. What are
you drawing,  Emily? A pea!

48
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.000
Lovely! And Pedro?

49
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.300
It’s a super potato.

50
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.000
Oh I see. And George
has drawn a wonderful tomato.

51
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.807
Peppa, what vegetable have you drawn?

52
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.171
My daddy, watching television.

53
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.634
Oh, excellent.

54
00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:34.185
Now, we put the drawings in
an envelope and post them to Mr. Potato.

55
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.100
It is morning and time
for the Mr. Potato show.

56
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.100
Please welcome your
friend and mine, Mr. Potato!

57
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.800
We posted some drawings
to Mr. Potato in an envelope.

58
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.600
Did you get the envelope?

59
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.700
He can’t hear you,
daddy. He is on television.

60
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.100
Oh, yes. Of course.

61
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.100
I’ve received an envelope full of drawings.

62
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.600
This tomato looks very juicy.

63
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.600
That’s George’s picture.

64
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.500
Well done, Geroge.

65
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.100
But this picture from
Peppa pig is my favorite.

66
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.100
Wow, that’s my picture!

67
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.000
It shows daddy pig watching TV.

68
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.800
Hmm, looks like daddy pig
needs some exercise. What?

69
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.300
Come on, daddy pig.

70
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.400
Let’s do some jumping up and down!

71
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.000
Oh, all right. Up, down, up, down…

72
00:04:39.218 --> 00:04:40.525
Daddy pig likes jumping up and down.

73
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:44.674
Everyone likes jumping up and down.

74
00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:47.099
Up and down, up and down,

75
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.100
all together now.
Mr. Potato is rolling around.

76
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.100
Your friends are mine.

77
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.000
He’s happy all the time.

78
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Mr. Potato is coming to town.
