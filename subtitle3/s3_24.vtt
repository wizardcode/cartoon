00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.900
Today, peppa and
 her family  have come to the funfair.

2
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.700
I love the funfair.

3
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.300
Sliding, sliding..

4
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.100
George wants to go to the helter skelter.

5
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.800
Ok. See you later.

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.600
See you later.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.300
Roll up, roll up.
Hook a duck and win a giant teddy.

8
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.300
Mummy, can we have a go?

9
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.800
Ok.

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.200
One pound, please.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.500
One pound?

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.100
It’s all for a good cause.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100
Win a giant teddy, mummy!

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.400
I’ll try, peppa,
but I don’t think it’s that easy.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
You are right. You’ve got no chance.

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.267
What?

17
00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:58.600
It’s impossible.
Waste of money, if you ask me.

18
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.700
We’ll see about that.

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.200
Mummy Pig has won.

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200
Hurray!

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.100
That’s amazing. Here’s your giant teddy.

22
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
Would you like a little
teddy instead, peppa?

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.700
No way who say.

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.000
Look, mummy. A giant teddy!

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.700
It’s a bit big.

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.800
No, it’s not.

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.000
George and daddy are
queuing for the helterselter.

28
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Hmm… it’s a bit high, George.
Are you sure you want to have a go?

29
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.900
One pound, please.

30
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
One pound?

31
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.400
It’s all for a good cause.

32
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.500
Oh dear. It is a bit too high for George.

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.100
Don’t worry George.
I will come up with you.

34
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.200
That’s one pound, please.

35
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Oh.

36
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.700
George isn’t afraid of height any more.

37
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.700
Oh, it is a bit high, isn’t it?
I’ll just go down the stairs.

38
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.002
The stairs are full of children.

39
00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:14.598
That’s the way down, daddy pig.

40
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.800
Oh, ok.

41
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.900
Roll up, roll up.
Hit the target and win a giant teddy.

42
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000
You can do that easy, mummy.

43
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.200
We do not want to win
another giant teddy, peppa.

44
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.500
Sound worry. You 
won’t win. women are useless at this.

45
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500
I’m sorry. What did you say?

46
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.400
It’s a game of skill.

47
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100
How much for one go?

48
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.600
Mummy Pig has won.

49
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.700
Unbelievable, here is your giant teddy.

50
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.700
Hurray!

51
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.700
I want a teddy like that one, mummy.

52
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.100
They are too big.

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.200
No, they are not.

54
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.200
Daddy pig and
 George are riding on the big wheel.

55
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.290
Hold tight now.

56
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.533
That really is high.

57
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.900
Oh, I’m glad that’s over.

58
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.900
Five times’ round for one pound.

59
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.900
Five times’ round? Oh, no.

60
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.641
Roll up, roll up. Test your
strength ? out hammer and bell.

61
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.330
What do we have to do?

62
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.808
You hit this button with this hammer.
If the bell rings, you win a prize.

63
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:47.407
No skill involved,
but you need to be strong.

64
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.200
I’ll have a go.

65
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.222
One pound.

66
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.100
Bad luck!

67
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.100
Hoho, I’m strong. I’ll have a go.

68
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.800
Stand back, everyone.

69
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.600
Do be careful,
daddy pig. You are no that fit.

70
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.722
Yes, daddy pig is ??dropping a bit tummy.

71
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.480
What?

72
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.600
I’m just saying 
daddy pig is a bit round in the tummy.

73
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.600
Give me that hammer.

74
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.065
Goodness me. 
I’ve never seen anything like it.

75
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.200
That wins all the giant teddies we have.

76
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.700
Hooray!

77
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.800
Mummy, can we give
these teddies to my friends?

78
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.000
What a good idea!

79
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.212
Thank you, peppa.

80
00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:40.500
Most kind.

81
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.558
Thank you very much.
